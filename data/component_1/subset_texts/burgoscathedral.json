Its official name is Santa Iglesia Catedral Baslica Metropolitana de Santa Mara de Burgos.Its construction began in 1221, in the style of French Gothic architecture and is based on a Latin cross. After a hiatus of almost 200years, it went through major embellishments of great splendor in the 15th and 16th centuries: the spires of the main facade, the and dome of the transept. These are elements of the flamboyant Gothic which gives the cathedral its unmistakable profile. The last works of importance (the Sacristy or the Chapel of Saint Thecla) were performed in the 18th century, during which the Gothic portals of the main facade were also modified. The style of the cathedral is the Gothic, although it has several decorative Renaissance and Baroque elements as well. The construction and renovations were made with limestone extracted from the quarries of the nearby town of Hontoria de la Cantera."}}
