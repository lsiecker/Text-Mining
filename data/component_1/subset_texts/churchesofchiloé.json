{"id": 64, "data": {"title": "Churches of Chilo\u00e9", "text": "The Churches of Chilo in Chile's Chilo Archipelago are a unique architectural phenomenon in the Americas and one of the most prominent styles of Chilota architecture. Unlike classical Spanish colonial architecture, the churches of Chilo are made entirely in native timber with extensive use of wood shingles. The churches were built from materials to resist the Chilo Archipelago's humid and rainy oceanic climate.Built in the 18th and 19th centuries when Chilo Archipelago was still a part of the Spanish Crown possessions, the churches represent the fusion of Spanish Jesuit culture and local native population's skill and traditions; an excellent example of mestizo culture."}}
