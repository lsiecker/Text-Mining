The site comprises ten churches or monasteries and related buildings around the city of Pskov in the Russian Federation.

The churches date from the 12th to the early 17th century, with the peak of this style in the 15th and 16th centuries. The architects from Pskov worked on monuments in several Russian cities, including Moscow, Kazan, and Sviyazhsk."}}
