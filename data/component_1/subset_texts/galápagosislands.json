{"id": 41, "data": {"title": "Gal\u00e1pagos Islands", "text": "The Galpagos Islands () are an archipelago of volcanic islands in the Eastern Pacific, located around the Equator west of South America. They form the Galpagos Province of the Republic of Ecuador, with a Spanish-speaking population of slightly over 33,000 . The province is divided into the cantons of San Cristbal, Santa Cruz, and Isabela, the three most populated islands in the chain. The Galpagos are famous for their large number of endemic species, which were studied by Charles Darwin in the 1830s and inspired his theory of evolution by means of natural selection. Many of the islands are protected as part of Ecuador's Galpagos National Park and Marine Reserve."}}
