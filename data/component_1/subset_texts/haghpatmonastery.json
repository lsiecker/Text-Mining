{"id": 253, "data": {"title": "Haghpat Monastery", "text": "Haghpat Monastery, also known as Haghpatavank (), is a medieval monastery complex in Haghpat, Armenia, built between the 10th and 13th century.Location.The location of Haghpat Monastery was chosen so that it overlooks the Debed River in northern Armenia's Lori region. It was built, not on a peak, but halfway up a hillside on a site chosen to afford protection and concealment from prying eyes and also in response to a kind of monastic humility. It is built on a verdant promontory located in the middle of a mountain cirque, which is often wreathed in clouds. A peak on the opposite side of the river is over 2,500 meters high. The monasteries of northern Armenia are not isolated, unlike their counterparts in the country's arid regions. They were built in a village environment and Haghpat is surrounded by many hamlets."}}
