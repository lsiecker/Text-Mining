{"id": 202, "data": {"title": "Ningaloo Coast", "text": "The Ningaloo Coast is a World Heritage Site located in the north west coastal region of Western Australia. The heritage-listed area is located approximately north of Perth, along the East Indian Ocean. The distinctive Ningaloo Reef that fringes the Ningaloo Coast is long and is Australia's largest fringing coral reef and the only large reef positioned very close to a landmass. The Muiron Islands and Cape Farquhar are within this coastal zone.The coast and reef draw their name from the Australian Aboriginal Wajarri language word \"ningaloo\" meaning \"promontory\", \"deepwater\", or \"high land jutting into the sea\". The Yamatji peoples of the Baiyungu and Yinigudura are the traditional owners of the area."}}
