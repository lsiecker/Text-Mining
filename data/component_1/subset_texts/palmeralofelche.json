{"id": 233, "data": {"title": "Palmeral of Elche", "text": "The Palmeral or Palm Grove of Elche (; Valencian: \"Palmerar d'Elx\") is the generic name for a system of date palm orchards in the city of Elche, Spain.The Palmeral was planted in Roman times and underwent modifications in the medieval period under Islamic and Christian rulers.The Roman empire introduced water management techniques to Elche, but the 10th c. Islamic Caliphate of Crdoba and later rulers of Al-Andalus planted palm groves and garden-estates in \"huertos\" (rectangular base agricultural units). Islamic rulers also constructed the largest canal system sections in Elche. In the 13th century Christian rulers conquered Elche and expanded the canal system. Industrialization and urban sprawl contracted the Palmeral in the late 19th and 20th century. The Spanish national government and Valencian regional government enacted legislation to protect the Palm Grove. In 2000, UNESCO designated the Palmeral a World Heritage Site, but climate change, pests, and disease threaten the site. The Palmeral includes a National Artistic Garden, Palm Grove Museum, Route of El Palmeral, and Municipal Park."}}
