It is often simply referred to as the Hypogeum (), literally meaning \"underground\" in Greek. The Hypogeum is thought to have been a sanctuary and necropolis, with the estimated remains of more than 7,000 people documented by archeologists, and is among the best preserved examples of the Maltese temple building culture that also produced the Megalithic Temples and Xagra Stone Circle."}}
