{"id": 45, "data": {"title": "Angkor", "text": "Angkor ( , 'Capital city'), also known as Yasodharapura (; ), was the capital city of the Khmer Empire. The city and empire flourished from approximately the 9th to the 15th centuries. The city houses the Angkor Wat, one of Cambodia's most popular tourist attractions.The name \"Angkor\" is derived from \"nokor\" (), a Khmer word meaning \"kingdom\" which in turn derived from Sanskrit \"nagara\" (), meaning \"city\". The Angkorian period began in AD 802, when the Khmer Hindu monarch Jayavarman II declared himself a \"universal monarch\" and \"god-king\", and lasted until the late 14th century, first falling under Ayutthayan suzerainty in 1351. A Khmer rebellion against Siamese authority resulted in the 1431 sacking of Angkor by Ayutthaya, causing its population to migrate south to Longvek."}}
