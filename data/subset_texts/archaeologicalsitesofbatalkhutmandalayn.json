They were declared World Heritage by UNESCO in 1988.\nHistory or prehistory.\nStudies during the last 15 years have shown the existence of numerous human settlements ranging from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman.\nBat.\nThe site of Bat is located inside a palm grove. Around 3000 B.C., there was an intense trade of copper (extracted locally) and stone (probably diorite) with Sumerians. The necropolis consists of 100 graves and circular buildings each with a diameter of about . These buildings have no outside openings, so besides the possibility of their ritualistic function, they may have been used as tanks or silos. Their precise function is as of yet unknown. In 1972, the excavations carried out by a Danish team led by Karen Frifelt showed that the area has been continuously inhabited for 4000 years.\nAl-Khutm.\nThe ruins at Al-Khutm are thought to have derived from a stone fort, with a tower made of rock with a diameter of . They are located west of Bat.\nAl-Ayn.\nAl-Ayn is a small necropolis, although it is in the best condition of the three necropolises. It is located southeast of Bat.\nConservation.\nThe sites have not been subjected to restoration or other types of conservation before the protection provided by UNESCO, so their isolation has been their only protection. One of the greatest dangers concerning the sites preservation comes from locals who take building material from the archaeological sites.\nDevelopment.\nA road between Oman and Saudi Arabia, which goes through the villages, was completed in September 2021."}}
