It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 for its pristine tropical rainforest ecosystem.\nThe forest received material support from Microsoft co-founder Jeff Harbers. \nEnvironment.\nThe reserve is in the Guianan moist forests ecoregion.\nIt contains of both montane and lowland primary tropical forest including sections of the Guyana Highlands.\nIt is known for its rapids and bird species, including the Guiana Cock of the Rock (\"Rupicola rupicola\"). Over 5,000 different plants have been identified, and large mammals like the jaguar, giant armadillo, and eight species of primates. A research station is located at the foot of Voltzberg and the area is tourist attraction.\nSome of the most outstanding features in Central Suriname Nature Reserve are several granite domes  uplifted monoliths of granite rising high above the surrounding rainforest. Barren surface of dark-colored granite is exposed to impact of Sun thus creating unique xerophytic biotope which includes also endemic plant species. The best known granite dome is the 245 m high Voltzberg.\nOther attractions include the Julianatop (1,230 m), the highest mountain in Suriname, the Tafelberg (Table Mountain, 1,026 meters), the Hendriktop (908 m), the Van Stockumberg (360 m), and Duivelsei (\"Devil's Egg\"), a rock seemingly balanced on the edge of a mountain.\nThe Eilerts de Haan Mountains are named for Johannes Gijsbert Willem Jacobus Eilerts de Haan, an explorer who died in Suriname's interior."}}
