{"id": 96, "data": {"title": "Churches of Chilo\u00e9", "text": "The Churches of Chilo in Chile's Chilo Archipelago are a unique architectural phenomenon in the Americas and one of the most prominent styles of Chilota architecture. Unlike classical Spanish colonial architecture, the churches of Chilo are made entirely in native timber with extensive use of wood shingles. The churches were built from materials to resist the Chilo Archipelago's humid and rainy oceanic climate.\nBuilt in the 18th and 19th centuries when Chilo Archipelago was still a part of the Spanish Crown possessions, the churches represent the fusion of Spanish Jesuit culture and local native population's skill and traditions; an excellent example of mestizo culture.\nThe Churches of Chilo were designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2000. The University of Chile, Fundacin Cultural Iglesias de Chilo and other institutions have led efforts to preserve these historic structures and to publicize them for their unique qualities.\nLocation.\nThe sixteen churches registered as part of the World Heritage Site are concentrated in the central eastern zone of the archipelago."}}
