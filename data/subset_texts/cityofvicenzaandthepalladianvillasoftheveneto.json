{"id": 57, "data": {"title": "City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto", "text": "City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto is a World Heritage Site in Italy, which protects buildings by the architect Andrea Palladio. UNESCO inscribed the site on the World Heritage List in 1994. At first the site was called \"Vicenza, City of Palladio\" and only buildings in the immediate area of Vicenza were included.\nVarious types of buildings were represented in the original site, which included the Basilica Palladiana, Teatro Olimpico and \"palazzi\" in the city itself, along with a few villas in the vicinity. However, most of Palladio's surviving villas lay outside the site. In 1996 the site was expanded. Its present name reflects the fact that it includes all the Palladian Villas of the Veneto. \"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\" also has some examples of ecclesiastical architecture, including the relatively small church at Maser. In total there are 47 Palladian buildings registered in the UNESCO list in the Veneto region.\nThere is another important group of urban buildings by Palladio in Venice, a city which also has World Heritage Site status. Venice has notable examples of ecclesiastical architecture by Palladio, including the San Giorgio Maggiore (church), Venice.\nList of sites in the center of Vicenza.\nThe World Heritage List have been registered since 1994: the historic center of Vicenza with the 23 Palladian monuments located within the ancient medieval walls of the city.\nList of villas.\nLater in 1996, the site was extended by inserting another 24 Palladian villas distributed in the Veneto region\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}}
