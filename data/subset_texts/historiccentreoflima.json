{"id": 196, "data": {"title": "Historic Centre of Lima", "text": "Located principally in the city centre or Cercado de Lima and Rmac areas, the Historic Centre of Lima is among the most important tourist destinations in Peru.Foundation.The city of Lima, the capital of Peru, was founded by Francisco Pizarro on 18 January 1535 and given the name City of the Kings. Nevertheless, with time its original name persisted, which may come from one of two sources: Either the Aymara language \"lima-limaq\" (meaning \"yellow flower\"), or the Spanish pronunciation of the Quechuan word \"rimaq\" (meaning \"talker\", and actually written and pronounced \"limaq\" in the nearby Quechua I languages). It is worth nothing that the same Quechuan word is also the source of the name given to the river that feeds the city, the Rmac River (pronounced as in the politically dominant Quechua II languages, with an \"r\" instead of an \"l\"). Early maps of Peru show the two names displayed jointly."}}
