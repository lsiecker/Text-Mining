Nevertheless, with time its original name persisted, which may come from one of two sources: Either the Aymara language \"lima-limaq\" (meaning \"yellow flower\"), or the Spanish pronunciation of the Quechuan word \"rimaq\" (meaning \"talker\", and actually written and pronounced \"limaq\" in the nearby Quechua I languages). It is worth nothing that the same Quechuan word is also the source of the name given to the river that feeds the city, the Rmac River (pronounced as in the politically dominant Quechua II languages, with an \"r\" instead of an \"l\").
