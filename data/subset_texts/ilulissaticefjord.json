{"id": 361, "data": {"title": "Ilulissat Icefjord", "text": "Ilulissat Icefjord () is a fjord in western Greenland. Located 250 km north of the Arctic Circle, the Ilulissat Icefjord runs west from the Greenland ice sheet to Disko Bay just south of the town of Ilulissat. Ilulissat Icefjord was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004 because of its natural beauty and the importance of the fast-moving Jakobshavn Glacier in developing the current scientific understanding of anthropogenic climate change. \n&lt;mapframe text=\"Map of Ilulissat Icefjord\" width=300 height=300 zoom=7 latitude=69.15 longitude=-50.2&gt;\n&lt;/mapframe&gt;\nGeography.\nThe fjord contains the Jakobshavn Glacier (), the most productive glacier in the Northern Hemisphere. The glacier flows at a rate of per day, resulting in around 20billion tonnes of icebergs calved off and passing out of the fjord every year.\nIcebergs breaking from the glacier are often so large up to a kilometer (3,300ft) in height that they are too tall to float down the fjord and lie stuck on the bottom of its shallower areas, sometimes for years, until they are broken up by the force of the glacier and icebergs further up the fjord. On breaking up the icebergs emerge into the open sea and initially travel north with ocean currents before turning south and running into the Atlantic Ocean. Larger icebergs typically do not melt until they reach 40-45 degrees north further south than the United Kingdom and level with New York City."}}
