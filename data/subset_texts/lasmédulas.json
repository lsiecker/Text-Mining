{"id": 282, "data": {"title": "Las M\u00e9dulas", "text": "Las Mdulas () is a historic gold-mining site near the town of Ponferrada in the comarca of El Bierzo (province of Len, Castile and Len, Spain). It was the most important gold mine, as well as the largest open-pit gold mine in the entire Roman Empire. Las Mdulas Cultural Landscape is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Advanced aerial surveys conducted in 2014 using LIDAR have confirmed the wide extent of the Roman-era works. The spectacular landscape of Las Mdulas resulted from the (wrecking of the mountains), a Roman mining technique described by Pliny the Elder in 77 AD. The technique employed was a type of hydraulic mining which involved undermining a mountain with large quantities of water. The water was supplied by interbasin transfer. At least seven long aqueducts tapped the streams of the La Cabrera district (where the rainfall in the mountains is relatively high) at a range of altitudes. The same aqueducts were used to wash the extensive alluvial gold deposits."}}
