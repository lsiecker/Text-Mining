Currently, the national park is encircled by the forest reserve. In April 1978, the area was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Combined, the national park and forest reserve became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.\nThe Government of Kenya had four reasons for creating a national park on and around Mount Kenya. These were the importance of tourism for the local and national economies, to preserve an area of great scenic beauty, to conserve the biodiversity within the park, and to preserve the water-catchment for the surrounding area.\nArea.\nThe national park has an area of , most of which is above the contour line. The forest reserve has an area of . Combined, this makes the area of the UNESCO World Heritage Site .\nVolcanic sediment in the surrounding region's soil and the huge volume of fresh water coming down the slopes makes the area particularly favorable for agriculture.\nFauna.\nA small portion of this park's borders near heavy populations has electrified fences to keep the elephants out of the surrounding farmland. At lower elevations, black-and-white colobus and other monkeys, and Cape buffaloes are prevalent. In 1993, a huge male lion weighing was shot near the mountain."}}
