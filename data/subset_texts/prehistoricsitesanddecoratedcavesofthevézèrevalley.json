{"id": 362, "data": {"title": "Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves of the V\u00e9z\u00e8re Valley", "text": "The Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves of the Vzre Valley is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in France since 1979. It specifically lists 15 prehistoric sites in the Vzre valley in the Dordogne department, mostly in and around Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil, which has been called the \"Capital of Prehistory\". This valley is exceptionally rich in prehistoric sites, with more than 150 known sites including 25 decorated caves, and has played an essential role in the study of the Paleolithic era and its art. Three of the sites are the namesakes for prehistoric periods; the Micoquien (named after La Micoque), Mousterian (after Le Moustier), and Magdalenian (after Abri de la Madeleine). Furthermore, the Cro-Magnon rock shelter gave its name to the Cro-Magnon, the generic name for the European early modern humans. Many of the sites were discovered or first recognised as significant and scientifically explored by the archaeologists Henri Breuil and Denis Peyrony in the early twentieth century, while Lascaux, which has the most exceptional rock art of these, was discovered in 1940."}}
