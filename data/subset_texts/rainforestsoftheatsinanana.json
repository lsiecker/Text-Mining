{"id": 328, "data": {"title": "Rainforests of the Atsinanana", "text": "The Rainforests of the Atsinanana is a World Heritage Site that was inscribed in 2007 and consists of 13 specific areas in six national parks in the eastern part of Madagascar:\nThe Rainforests of the Atsinanana are distributed along the eastern part of the island. These relict forests are critically important for maintaining ongoing ecological processes necessary for the survival of Madagascars unique biodiversity, which reflects the islands geological history. Having completed its separation from all other land masses more than 60 million years ago, Madagascars plant and animal life evolved in isolation. The rainforests are inscribed for their importance to both ecological and biological processes as well as their biodiversity and the threatened species they support. Many species are rare and threatened especially lemurs and other primates."}}
