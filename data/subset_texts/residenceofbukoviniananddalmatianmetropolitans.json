{"id": 29, "data": {"title": "Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans", "text": "The Residence of Bukovinian and Dalmatian Metropolitans in Chernivtsi, Ukraine was built for the Eastern Orthodox metropolitan bishop between 1864 and 1882 to the designs of the Czech architect Josef Hlvka from Austria-Hungary. The Residence, whose buildings are now part of Chernivtsi University, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.Construction.In 1782, following the incorporation of Bukovina into the Habsburg monarchy, the seat of the Moldavian Eastern Orthodox Bishops of Rdui was moved to Chernivtsi (then known as Czernowitz). The province's military administration built a residence in haste for bishop . The edifice, completed in 1783, bore a shabby aspect, divided as it was into small, low rooms, with a little chapel that had a brick floor. Due to fungal growth caused by humidity, part of the building collapsed in 1790 and the rest was demolished. Thus, Herescu and his successors Daniil Vlahovici, Isaia Baloescu and, for a time, Eugenie Hacman, were obliged to move around rented rooms. In 18511852, Hacman sent a series of reports to the administration in Lviv, complaining that this situation was undignified. In 1860, the Religious Affairs Ministry issued a decree announcing a contest to select an architect for a new episcopal residence. The Czech architect Josef Hlvka was selected to develop the project."}}
