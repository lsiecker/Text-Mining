{"id": 363, "data": {"title": "Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France", "text": "UNESCO designated the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France as a World Heritage Site in December 1998. The routes pass through the following regions of France: Aquitaine, Auvergne, Basse-Normandie, Bourgogne, Centre, Champagne-Ardenne, Ile-de-France, Languedoc-Roussillon, Limousin, Midi-Pyrnes, Picardie, Poitou-Charentes, and Provence-Alpes-Cte d'Azur. UNESCO cites the routes' role in \"religious and cultural exchange\", the development of \"specialized edifices\" along the routes, and their \"exceptional witness to the power and influence of Christian faith among people of all classes and countries in Europe during the Middle Ages\".\nUNESCO designated 71 structures along the routes and seven stretches of the Chemin du Puy. The structures are largely monuments, churches, or hospitals that provided services to pilgrims headed to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Some are places of pilgrimage in their own right. Other structures include a tower, a bridge, and a city gate.\nStructures.\nThe sites included in the UNESCO designation are largely monuments, churches, or hospitals that provided services to pilgrims headed to Santiago de Compostela in Spain.
