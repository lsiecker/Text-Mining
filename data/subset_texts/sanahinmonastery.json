{"id": 358, "data": {"title": "Sanahin Monastery", "text": "Sanahin Monastery () is an Armenian monastery founded in the 10th century in Sanahin in the Lori Province of Armenia.The name Sanahin literally translates from Armenian as 'this one is older than that one', presumably representing a claim to being an older monastery than the neighbouring Haghpat Monastery, together with which it forms a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The two villages and their monasteries are similar in many ways, and lie in plain view of each other on a dissected plateau formation, separated by a deep crack formed by a small river flowing into the Debed river."}}
