The area was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1927 due to the unique geography, preserved mangrove forests, and wild bird and lemur populations.\nNational Park.\nThe southern end of the protected area was changed into the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park in 1997, while the northern end of the protected area remains as a strict nature reserve (Rserve Naturelle Intgrale). Borders were most recently adjusted in 2011. \nIt is characterised by needle-shaped limestone formations, above cliffs over the Manambolo River. The incredibly sharp limestone formations can cut through equipment and flesh easily, which makes traversing them extremely difficult. The word \"Tsingy\" is derived from a local word meaning \"the place where one cannot walk barefoot\".\nTourism.\nTourists can access the national park by road from Morondava, a town 150km south of the park. Limited access is also possible from the town of Antsalova, which can be reached by plane from Antananarivo or Mahajanga."}}
