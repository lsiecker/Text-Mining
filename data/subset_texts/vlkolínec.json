The first written mention of the village came from 1376 and after 1882 it became part of Ruomberok. Its name is probably derived from the Slovak word \"vlk\", i.e. wolf.Vlkolnec has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993, and is one of ten Slovak villages that have been given the status of a folk architecture reservations. This status was granted because the village is an untouched and complex example of folk countryside architecture of the region of the Northern Carpathians."}}
