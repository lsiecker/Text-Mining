It was originally built in 1923 as an Italian air force base called . It became a German air base during World War II. The airbase was captured by the British 8th Army in January 1943 and transferred to the control of the US Army Air Forces, who called it Mellaha AAF until 1945, when they renamed it Wheelus Air Base for a US airman killed that year. American use continued until the 1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat and the subsequent expiration of the lease. When the Americans left, the base was renamed Okba Ben Nafi Air Base (\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0639\u0642\u0628\u0629 \u0628\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u064a\u0629) after the Islamic general who conquered North Africa. It was used by both the Libyan and Soviet air forces. The United States bombed the base in 1986 during Operation El Dorado Canyon. In 1995, the air base was converted to a second civilian airport for Tripoli, and was given its current name.\nHistory.\nThe airport was originally built in 1923 by the Italian Air Force as Mellaha Air Base (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0627\u0651\u062d\u0629). A motor racing circuit was subsequently built around the airport and Mellaha Lake began hosting the popular Tripoli Grand Prix in 1933.\nMellaha was used by the German Luftwaffe during the North African Campaign, with the Germans using it for short range recon units, as well as coastal and naval recon units. Special weather recon units also existed at Mehalla. The main Luftwaffe unit stationed at the base was the 2nd Staffel of the Aufkl\u00e4rungsgruppe (H) 14 or 2.(H)/14. The squadron was equipped with twelve single-engined Henschel Hs 126, an aircraft with 2-man crews, which could cover approx 710\u00a0km, with a maximum speed of 360\u00a0km/h, as well as three Fieseler Fi 156 Storch liaison aircraft, and a Junkers Ju 52 for transport of men and materiel.\nThe airbase was captured by the British 8th Army in January 1943. The US Army Air Force began using Mellaha as a base in January 1943. It was used by the 376th Bombardment Group (Heavy) of the 12th Air Force for B-24 bomb missions into Italy and southern parts of Germany. In addition, Mellaha Field was used by Air Transport Command. It functioned as a stopover en route to Benina Airport near Benghazi or to Tunis Airport, Tunisia on the North African Cairo-Dakar transport route for cargo, transiting aircraft and personnel.\nOn 15 April 1945 Mellaha AAF was taken over by USAAF's Air Training Command. It was renamed Wheelus Army Air Field (AAF) on 17 May 1945 in honor of USAAF Lieutenant Richard Wheelus who had died earlier that year in a plane crash in Iran. During the USAFs tenure the base was extended, demolishing the derelict motor racing buildings. A 1954 agreement with Libya extended use of the base until 1971, but changing needs led the United States to withdraw completely by 1970, handing the facility over to the new Libyan government that had taken power a year earlier in the 1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat.\nLibyan/Soviet use.\nAfter the US Air Force left in 1970, the base was renamed Okba Ben Nafi Air Base (seemingly after the legendary hero Uqba ibn Nafi) and served as a Libyan People's Air Force (LPAF) installation. OBN AB housed the LPAF's headquarters and a large share of its major training facilities. In addition, aircraft and personnel of the Soviet Air Force took up residence at the base.\nLPAF Soviet-made MiG-17/19/25 fighters and Tu-22 bombers were based at Okba Ben Nafi Air Base. Of the combat aircraft, the US State Department estimated in 1983 that fifty percent remained in storage, including most of the MiG fighters and Tu-22 bombers.\nOperation El Dorado Canyon.\nIn 1986, the base was a primary target of Operation El Dorado Canyon, a US retaliatory air strike against Libya for missile attacks on US aircraft over disputed territorial waters in the Mediterranean Sea and Libyan involvement in terrorist attacks on US servicemen in Europe. At 2 a.m. on 16 April 1986, Okba Ben Nafi AB, various Libyan government buildings, and three of thirty alleged Libyan terrorist training camps were bombed by F-111Fs from the USAFE's 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, flying non-stop from RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, to Libya.\nOperation El Dorado Canyon included eighteen 48 TFW F-111F \"Aardvark\" fighter-bombers (Pave Tack-equipped), five EF-111A \"Sparkvarks\" from the 66th Electronic Combat Wing/42nd Electronic Combat Squadron at RAF Upper Heyford, UK, and carrier-based US Navy F-14 Tomcats and A-6E Intruders. The 66 ECW Sparkvarks formed up with the attack force to provide electronic defense during the attack. One 48 TFW F-111F was lost outbound from the attack to (presumably) a SAM or AAA hit. The 48 TFW that bombed the base had practiced for years with F-100s at this very same air base when it was Wheelus Air Base and later at Zaragoza AB Spain with F-4D Phantoms and F-111s for just such a mission.\nThe fourteen-hour round trip to Libya required repeated in-air refueling (over seven million pounds of fuel), because countries closer to Libya\u00a0\u2013 Spain, Italy, France, and Greece\u00a0\u2013 had refused American planes permission to fly over or from bases in their countries.\nPost\u2013Cold War.\nOkba Ben Nafi AB was converted for civilian use and became Mitiga Airport in 1995. The airport also housed the headquarters of Buraq Air.\n2011 Libyan civil war.\nDuring the 2011 Libyan civil war, the \"Times of Malta\" and \"The Guardian\" reported claims that the airport had been taken over by protesters opposed to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. On 13 March 2011, Ali Atiyya, a colonel of the Libyan Air Force at the airport, defected and joined the anti-Gaddafi forces. On 21 August 2011, rebels launched an assault on Mitiga as part of a bid to battle loyalist forces in Tripoli, sustaining a number of casualties in the process. On 25 October 2011 Google Earth released multispectral imagery from GeoEye taken on 28 August 2011 which showed the airfield as well as the highly capable MiG-25 aircraft with no visible damage. This imagery helped corroborate reporting which suggested that the airfield had been taken over early on by opposition protesters; moreover, NATO and US air forces would have wanted to avoid collateral damage to the opposition movement.\n2014 Libyan civil war.\nDuring the 2019\u201320 Western Libya campaign, the airport, held by military units loyal to the Government of National Accord, was repeatedly targeted with airstrikes from the opposing Libyan National Army in order to enforce a no-fly zone declared by the LNA several days prior. On 8 April 2019, an airport spokesman announced that the airport was forced to close due to airstrikes.\nTunisAir was the first foreign carrier to resume flights to the airport, in May 2021."}

It is named after the German scientist Alexander von Humboldt who visited the island in 1800 and 1801. The park was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001 for of its size, altitude range, complex lithology, landform diversity, and wealth of endemic flora and fauna.\nGeography.\nThe rivers that flow off the peaks of the park are some of the largest in the insular Caribbean. The park is said to be the most humid place in Cuba and this causes a high biological diversity. The park has an area of , of which land area and marine area. Elevation ranges from sea level to on \"El Toldo\" Peak.\nThe region around Alejandro de Humboldt National Park is geologically complex, containing karst landscapes that originated from oceanic crust in the Cretaceous period. Unique to this region, the landscape is ultrabasic, dominated by serpentine soils and peridotites. \nWildlife.\nThe area comprising the national park was a Pleistocene refugium, retaining a relatively stable climate through the repeated glaciation events. This has allowed for remarkably high rates of endemism and biodiversity in the park. In addition, the ultra-basic rocks are relatively toxic to plants, driving rapid speciation. 16 of Cuba's 28 endemic plant species are protected in the park including such flora as \"Dracaena cubensis\" and \"Podocarpus ekman\". Fauna present in the park includes various species of parrots, lizards, hummingbirds, the endangered Cuban solenodon (endemic), hutia and snails.\nOver 900 total plant species have been recorded at the park, along with 45 species of reptiles, 21 amphibian species, and 10 mammal species.\nImportant Bird Area.\nThe park has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of northern bobwhites, white crowned and plain pigeons, grey-fronted and blue-headed quail-doves, Antillean nighthawks, Cuban nightjars, Antillean palm-swifts, Cuban emeralds, bee hummingbirds, great lizard cuckoos, Cuban pygmy owls, bare-legged owls, Cuban kites, Gundlach's hawks, Cuban trogons and todies, ivory-billed, Cuban green and West Indian woodpeckers, Cuban amazons and parakeets, loggerhead and giant kingbirds, La Sagra's flycatchers, Cuban pewees, vireos, crows, gnatcatchers and solitaires, Oriente warblers, Cuban orioles, tawny-shouldered and Cuban blackbirds, Greater Antillean grackles, western spindalises, and Cuban bullfinches and grassquits.\nHistory.\nThe Alexander von Humboldt National Park has historically been an area of land little used by man, with only one archaeological site from the pre-Columbian period being known; this is located in the coastal zone of Aguas Verdes. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries some peripheral places were used as refuges or camps by maroons.\nThe park began to be laid out in the 1960s, with the declaration of the Jaguani and Cupeyal del Norte nature reserves. This continued into the 1980s with the proposal of the Ojito del Agua Refuge, associated with the last sighting of the royal woodpecker, a last remnant of this species which was already extinct in its other habitats in the United States and Mexico. In 1996 these protected areas were united to form a national park that was named after Alexander von Humboldt. Being one of the most important biosphere reserves in the Caribbean basin, the national park, along with Cuchillas del Toa was declared a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site in 2001.\nThere are unique flora and fauna elements in this unique ecosystem, with some of the highest indexes of endemicity in the archipelago."}

He was the eldest son of 'Adud al-Dawla.\nEarly life.\nWhen Kerman was conquered by his father in 968, Shirdil was appointed as viceroy to that province. For some time after 977 he resided in Baghdad, but was then sent back to Kerman. As the eldest son, Shirdil regarded himself as the successor to his father; 'Adud al-Dawla's apparent preference for his second son Marzuban therefore made him hostile toward his brother. 'Adud al-Dawla never definitively named a successor by the time of his death in 983. Marzuban (now Samsam al-Dawla) took power in Baghdad as senior amir, but Shirdil also laid his claims to the succession, and from Kerman he invaded and captured Fars.\nReign.\nShirdil, who now used the title \"Sharaf al-Dawla\" (), soon found his position surrounded by enemies. In the west, Samsam al-Dawla ruled in Baghdad, while two more of his brothers, Taj al-Dawla and Diya' al-Dawla, were in control of Basra and Khuzestan. To the north, Fakhr al-Dawla ruled in Ray. The next few years were spent by Sharaf al-Dawla fighting against all of these individuals. He provided support to the Samanids when Fakhr al-Dawla attempted to wrest Khorasan from them. Despite this, the rulers of Basra and Khuzestan soon acknowledged Fakhr al-Dawla as senior amir, making the latter the most powerful of the Buyids.\nDespite this turn of events, Sharaf al-Dawla was able to expand his position. He recovered Buyid Oman, which had earlier seceded to Samsam al-Dawla. In early 986 he captured Basra and Khuzestan, forcing the two brothers to flee to Fakhr al-Dawla's territory. He then took on Samsam al-Dawla; by May or June 986 the latter recognized Sharaf al-Dawla as senior amir. Sharaf al-Dawla probably intended to invade Fakhr al-Dawla's realm, but Iraq soon slipped into anarchy and he was forced to intervene there. He entered Baghdad in 987, deposed Samsam al-Dawla and imprisoned him along with his official Fuladh ibn Manadhar in Fars. He also had the Daylamite officer Ziyar ibn Shahrakawayh executed. In July of that year the caliph proclaimed Sharaf senior amir.\nSharaf al-Dawla next planned to subdue the Kurd Badr ibn Hasanwayh, who had taken over Diyarbakr during Samsam al-Dawla's reign and was an ally of Fakhr al-Dawla. The campaign failed, and not long afterwards Sharaf al-Dawla died, either in 988 or 989. He had managed to mostly preserve 'Adud al-Dawla's empire, but the Buyids of Ray under Fakhr al-Dawla had become effectively independent. He was succeeded by his brother Baha' al-Dawla, but Samsam al-Dawla escaped from prison and captured Fars, Kerman and Khuzestan."}

Along with the Control Yuan (upper house) and the Legislative Yuan (lower house), the National Assembly formed the tricameral parliament of China. If still functional, at 3,045 members, the National Assembly would have been the largest parliamentary chamber in the world.\nSimilar to other electoral colleges, the National Assembly had elected the President and Vice President under the 1947 Constitution of the Republic of China with the role of the constituent assembly that aimed to amend the country's constitution.\nThe first National Assembly was elected in November 1947 and met in Nanjing in March 1948. However, in the next year, the Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China lost mainland China in the Civil War and retreated to Taiwan. The National Assembly resumed its meeting in Taipei in 1954. In the 1990s, its parliamentary powers were gradually transferred to the Legislative Yuan and direct democracy exercised by the \"de facto\" residents before constitutional amendments made it a dormant body in 2000 and \"de facto\" dissolved in 2005.\nHistory.\nEarly Republican period.\nCalls for a National Assembly were part of the platform of the revolutionaries who ultimately overthrew the Qing dynasty. In response, the Qing dynasty formed the first assembly in 1910, but it was virtually powerless and intended only as an advisory body. In the early Republican Era, the bicameral National Assembly was established by the Beiyang government. The design referred to the structure of the United States Congress as Senate () and House of Representatives (). However, the Warlord Era with the interference of military power toward the constitution suppressed the authority and the reputation of the National Assembly.\n\"The Chinese social and political science review\" quoted the institution's English name as \"National People's Congress\" during the drafting of constitution.\n1947 Constitution.\nIn 1946, the Constituent Assembly promulgated a new constitution and the first National Assembly met in 1948 in Nanjing, the Chinese capital. Apart from the KMT, the only legal parties were the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party.\nUnder the constitution, the main duty of the National Assembly was to elect the President and Vice President for terms of six years. It also had the right to recall or impeach the President and Vice President if they failed to fulfill their political responsibilities. According to \"National Assembly Duties Act\", the National Assembly could amend the constitution with a two-thirds majority, with at least three-quarters membership present, as well as to ratify constitutional amendments proposed by deputies of the Legislative Yuan. It could also change territorial boundaries. The responsibilities of the deputies of the Assembly, as well as of the Assembly as a whole, were derived from the directions of Sun Yat-sen. At that time the NA served as a counterpart to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, with a Presidium of the National Assembly governing over its activities.\nIn 1949, the Chinese Communist Party won the Chinese Civil War and mainland China became the People's Republic of China. The National Assembly (along with the entire ROC government) was relocated to Taipei. The Assembly's right to legislate was put into moratorium until at least half of all counties in the nation were again able to elect representatives via their County Assemblies.\nThe first National Assembly was to serve for a period of only six years. However, according to the Kuomintang (KMT) leadership, the fall of the Mainland made it impossible to hold new elections there, as all Mainland provinces were under \"Communist rebellion\". As a result, the Judicial Yuan decided that the original members of the National Assembly representing Communist-controlled constituencies must continue to hold office until new elections could be held. National Assembly elections were still held in territories under ROC control.\nIn accordance with the 76th interpretation of the 1947 Constitution by the Judicial Yuan in 1957, the NA formed part of a three-chamber tricameral parliament together with the Legislative and Control Yuans and was the senior most chamber of parliament, with the latter two performing regular legislative work in the absence of the Assembly. During the years when it elected or recalled the president and vice president, it acted as an electoral college with all its county representatives serving as electors.\nConstitutional reforms in the 1990s.\nAs a result of this decision, the same National Assembly, elected in 1947, remained for 44 years until 1991, when as part of a constitutional ruling a Second National Assembly was elected. There was strong objection to the Assembly, which was derisively called the \"\" by critics.\nShortly after passing constitutional reforms in 1991, the National Assembly held direct elections in December. Following a 1994 constitutional amendment, the Assembly essentially became a permanent constituent assembly, as the Assembly's other major role, to elect the President and Vice President of the Republic of China, was abolished. Direct elections for the president, vice president, and Assembly were held simultaneously in March 1996. However, these reforms granted it new functions, such as hearing the president's State of the Nation Address and approving the president's nominations of the grand justices and the heads of the Examination and Control Yuans. Following the assembly's abolition, these functions are now in the hands of the Legislative Yuan.\nIn 1999, the Assembly passed constitutional amendments which would link its election and term with the Legislative Yuan. Part of these amendments' effect was to extend the term of both bodies, which was strongly criticized by the public. The People First Party was founded shortly after the 2000 presidential election. The two larger parties, the Kuomintang and Democratic Progressive Party, wished to bar the People First Party (PFP) from the National Assembly. As a result, the 2000 National Assembly elections were canceled, and delegates were to be selected \"ad hoc\" on the basis of proportional representation via special election within six months of the Legislative Yuan proposing constitutional amendments, calling for the impeachment of the president or vice president, or declaring a vote on changes to national borders. However, no such situation arose from 2000 to 2004, and the National Assembly never met during this period.\nDissolution.\nOn 23 August 2004, the Legislative Yuan proposed a series of amendments that included dissolution of the National Assembly. The purpose of this proposal is to transfer power to ratify constitutional amendments and territorial amendments from the National Assembly to the people. Under the amendments, subsequent proposed amendments are to be approved by three-fourths of the present members in the Legislative Yuan, with at least three-fourths of all members present. It would then be promulgated for a period of 180 days and then submitted to a referendum, in which a simple majority of all eligible voters shall be sufficient to ratify the amendments. A Democratic Progressive Party proposal authorizing citizens' initiative rights to propose constitutional amendments was withdrawn after it became clear that such a proposal would not pass the Legislative Yuan. Opponents of such constitutional reforms argued that by eliminating the 3/4 legislative vote requirement, a relatively small number of voters could force a referendum on Taiwan independence which would trigger a crisis with the People's Republic of China. By contrast, keeping the 3/4 legislative vote requirement would mean that any constitutional amendment would require a consensus among both the pan-green coalition and pan-blue coalition to be considered. The requirement that a majority of all voters approve the amendment allows for a party to block an amendment by boycotting the vote as was done with the referendums voted on alongside the March 2004 presidential elections.\nUnder the Constitution at the time, the National Assembly must then be elected to consider these amendments. Such consideration and eventual ratification of the constitutional amendments was originally considered to be a formality, but a number of unexpected complications occurred in 2005. The first was the poor showing of the People First Party (PFP) in the 2004 Legislative Yuan election. The PFP was widely expected to merge with the KMT, but PFP Chairman James Soong became disenchanted by the idea. The second was the reluctance of the Taiwan Solidarity Union to pass the amendments. These amendments were seen by some Taiwan independence supporters as a prelude to a later declaration of independence, but the results of the 2004 election made this very unlikely. Faced with this outcome, the TSU became very reluctant to support a reform that would make elections by small parties such as itself harder.\nAnother unexpected event occurred which gave the National Assembly elections on 14 May 2005 more significance than had been intended: the election was lined up immediately after trips to mainland China by KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong. This had the effect of turning the May 14 elections into an opinion poll on relations with mainland China which was undesired by the Democratic Progressive Party, though the DPP subsequently gained a plurality in the elections.\nOn 7 June 2005, the 300 delegates voted (by a majority of 249 to 48) the constitutional amendments into effect, and so dissolved the National Assembly until the \"unification of the country\" as stated in the preamble.\nFunctions.\nThe National Assembly held the most important constitutional powers within the national organs under the 1947 constitution. All of its powers were transferred to the Legislative Yuan and direct democracy exercised by the citizens of the free area after a series of constitutional amendments as Additional Articles of the Constitution in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nThe series of constitutional amendments coined the Additional Articles of the Constitution as the current fundamental law of Taiwan. During the evolution of the Additional Articles, the National Assembly also held the power to confirm some important governmental officers to maintain the separation of powers during the government reorganization.\nElections and terms.\nThe Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China retreated to Taiwan in 1949, two years after the first election was held in China. As Kuomintang insists to claim the sovereignty over the whole China, the term of the members were extended until \"re-election is possible in their original electoral district.\" In response to the increasing democracy movement in Taiwan, limited supplementary elections were held in Taiwan starting from 1969 and parts of Fujian from 1972. Members elected in these supplementary elections served together with the members who were elected in 1948. This situation remained until a Constitutional Court (Judicial Yuan) ruling on June 21, 1991, that ordered the retirement of all members with extended terms by the end of year 1991.\nTimeline of National Assembly elections and terms\nLeaders of the National Assembly.\nSecretary-general.\nWhen the Assembly is not in session, the secretary-general () is the \"de facto\" highest-ranking official, in charge of the overall affairs of the Assembly and supervising its staff. Note that the secretary-general is entitled \"acting secretary-general\" when the National Assembly is not in session.\nPresidium and Speaker.\nThe 2005 \"ad hoc\" National Assembly elected a presidium with 11 members as follows:"}

The ship was the third US Navy ship to bear the name. \"Leyte\" was commissioned in April 1946, too late to serve in World War II. She spent most of her career in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean, but also saw service in the Korean War, in which she earned two battle stars. She was reclassified in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), then as an Antisubmarine Aircraft Carrier (CVS), and finally (after inactivation) as an aircraft transport (AVT).\nUnlike most of her sister ships, \"Leyte\" received no major modernizations, and thus throughout her career retained the classic appearance of a World War II \"Essex\"-class ship. She was decommissioned in 1959 and sold for scrap in 1970.\nConstruction and commissioning.\n\"Leyte\" was one of the \"long-hull\" ships. She was laid down as \"Crown Point\" on 21 February 1944 at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia, and renamed \"Leyte\" on 8 May 1945 to commemorate the recent Battle of Leyte Gulf. She was launched on 23 August, sponsored by Mrs. James M. Mead, and commissioned on 11 April 1946, with Captain Henry F. MacComsey in command.\nService history.\n\"Leyte\" joined battleship on a good will cruise along the western seaboard of South America in the fall of 1946 before returning to the Caribbean on 18 November to resume shakedown operations. In 1948, the carrier was equipped with its first helicopter detachment of HO3S-1 utility helicopters, and participated in a fleet exercise, \"Operation Frigid\", in the North Atlantic. In the years preceding the Korean War, the Leyte participated in numerous other fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean, trained naval reservists, and deployed three times to the Mediterranean: April\u2013June 1947, July\u2013November 1947, September 1949 \u2013 January 1950, and May\u2013August 1950. The latter included a demonstration of airpower over Beirut, Lebanon on 13 August, supporting the Middle East against Communist pressure. \"Leyte\" returned to Norfolk on 24 August, and after 2 weeks of preparation, departed on 6 September to join Task Force 77 (TF 77) in the Far East to support United Nations Forces in Korea.\n\"Leyte\" arrived at the Sasebo base for U.S. Fleet Activities in Sasebo, Japan, on 8 October 1950 and made final preparations for combat operations. From 9 October \u2013 19 January 1951, the ship and her aircraft spent 92 days at sea and flew 3,933 sorties against North Korean forces. Her pilots accumulated 11,000 hours in the air while inflicting massive damage upon enemy positions, supplies, transportation, and communications. Among the squadrons based on \"Leyte\" were the VF-32 Swordsmen, flying the F4U Corsair. This squadron included the first African-American naval aviator, Ensign Jesse LeRoy Brown, who was killed in action on 4 December 1950. \"Leyte\" returned to Norfolk for overhaul 25 February 1951.\nAfter fleet training exercises in the Caribbean terminated on 21 August, the carrier departed for her fifth tour of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet on 3 September. She returned to Norfolk on 21 December for operations out of Hampton Roads, and again steamed for the Mediterranean on 29 August 1952. Reclassified CVA-32 on 1 October, she returned to Boston on 16 February 1953 for deactivation. On 8 August, however, she was ordered to be retained in the active fleet, and, redesignated CVS-32 on the same day, work was begun converting her to an ASW carrier.\nAt 15:15 on 16 October 1953, while still under conversion to an antisubmarine carrier, \"Leyte\" suffered an explosion in her port catapult machinery room. Within minutes, naval base and city fire trucks were on the scene. After a hard and gallant fight, the fire was extinguished at 19:57. As a result of the fire, 37 men died and 28 were injured.\nConversion completed on 4 January 1954, \"Leyte\" departed Boston for Quonset Point, Rhode Island, as flagship of Carrier Division 18 (CarDiv 18). She remained there for the next five years conducting ASW tactical operations along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean.\n\"Leyte\" departed Quonset Point in January 1959 for the New York Navy Yard where she commenced preinactivation overhaul. She was redesignated AVT-10 and decommissioned both on 15 May 1959, and was assigned to the Philadelphia group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, where she remained until sold for scrap in September 1970 and completed in Chesapeake, Virginia."}

{"id": "214412", "revid": "4705841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214412", "title": "Constitution of the Republic of China", "text": "The Constitution of the Republic of China is the fifth and current constitution of the Republic of China (ROC), ratified by the Kuomintang during the session on 25 December 1946, in Nanjing, and adopted on 25 December 1947. The constitution, along with its Additional Articles, remains effective in ROC-controlled territories.\nIntended for the entire territory of the Republic of China as it was then constituted, it was never extensively nor effectively implemented due to the outbreak of the Chinese Civil War in mainland China at the time of the constitution's promulgation. The newly elected National Assembly soon ratified the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion on May 10, 1948. The Temporary Provisions symbolises the country's entering into the state of emergency and granted the Kuomintang-led government of the Republic of China extra-constitutional powers.\nFollowing the ROC government's retreat to Taiwan on 7 December 1949, the Temporary Provisions together with martial law made the country an authoritarian one-party state despite the constitution. Democratization began in the 1980s. Martial law was lifted in 1987, and in 1991 the Temporary Provisions were repealed. The Additional Articles of the Constitution was passed to reflect the government's actual jurisdiction and realization of cross-Strait relations. The Additional Articles also significantly changed the structure of the government to a semi-presidential system with a unicameral parliament, which formed the basis of a multi-party democracy in Taiwan.\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, the Constitution's origins in mainland China led to supporters of Taiwan independence to push for a new Taiwanese constitution. However, attempts by the Democratic Progressive Party administration to create a new Constitution during the second term of DPP President Chen Shui-bian failed, because the then opposition Kuomintang controlled the Legislative Yuan. It was only agreed to reform the Constitution of the Republic of China, not to create a new one. It was last amended in 2005, with the consent of both the KMT and the DPP. The most recent revision to the constitution took place in 2004.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nDynastic China adopted a constitutional system oscillating between a feudal distribution of power and a centralistic autocracy. The idea of a constitutional monarchy, and a written constitution, became influential towards the end of the 19th century, inspired immediately in large parts by the precedent of the Meiji Constitution in Japan. The first attempt towards constitutionalism in China was during the Hundred Days' Reform that took place in 1898 by the young Guangxu Emperor and his reform-minded supporters, but a coup by conservative monarchists loyal to Empress Dowager Cixi ended this effort. The same faction, however, eventually adopted a policy of transitioning towards constitutionalism. However, the first constitutional document was only published in 1908, and the first constitutional document with legal force (the \"Nineteen Covenants\") was not implemented until 1911, after the eruption of the 1911 Revolution, which led to the end of the Qing dynasty the next year.\nColonial history.\nAs a result of the First Sino-Japanese War, the Treaty of Shimonoseki granted Japan full sovereignty of Taiwan. Chinese cession of the Taiwanese Prefecture would facilitate the island's introduction to constitutional regimes: Japan had promulgated the Meiji Constitution six years prior. Thereafter, Japanese colonization stoked fierce debates surrounding the applicability of the Meiji Constitution towards colonial governments. Although the Meiji oligarchy declared that their constitution would not be applied to colonial possessions, Taiwanese people asserted that their naturalization as Japanese citizens guaranteed rights enumerated in the Meiji Constitution. These legal debates culminated in granting Taiwan special legal status\u2014Taiwan nominally became governed by constitutional rule. However, constitutional rights were continuously violated by the Japanese military and state police. Representative institutions were not constitutionally installed. Likewise, Emperor Meiji granted the majority of executive and legislative powers to the Governor-General of Taiwan, an appointed military leader.\nThe 1920s saw the rise of indigenous political movements as Taiwanese activists sought local autonomy and greater political freedoms. From 1921 to 1934, political activists attempted to petition the Imperial Japanese government to establish Taiwanese parliamentary assembly, which was met with little success. Conversely, the formation of the Taiwan Local Autonomy Alliance () in 1930 eventually contributed the limited city and township council elections in 1935. Caving to these political movements, the Japanese colonial government established councils to integrate public opinion with the state. Half of the council members were to be directly elected by voters while the remaining half of council members were to be appointed by the government. November 22, 1935, marked the landmark day where Taiwan's autonomous regional bodies held elections. Only adult males of higher socio-economic status were eligible to participate.\nThe Meiji Constitution would not be Taiwan's last constitutional imposition: Taiwan would face another constitutional crisis when China's KMT government fled to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. According to Taiwanese legal scholar Yeh Jiunn-rong, these constitutions would impart a lasting legacy on Taiwan's constitutionalism: they inspired constitutional indigenization with their disparate frameworks, serving as a foundation for Taiwan's eventual constitutional identity. Even today, remnants of Japanese colonialism exist within Taiwan's political systems. Up until 2005, Taiwan retained its single non-transferable voting (SNTV) system, a testament to the Meiji Constitution. Originating in Japan, the SNTV system grants voters one vote in multi-member districts. Unlike single transferable voting (STV), votes are non-transferable. Thus, surplus votes from one candidate cannot be transferred to other candidates. This electoral system lasted in Japan until 1994, yet persists in a limited form in Taiwan.\nEarly attempts of Chinese constitution.\nThe Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China was drawn up in March 1912 and formed the basic government document of the Republic of China until 1928. It provided a Western-style parliamentary system headed by a weak president. However, the system was quickly usurped when Song Jiaoren was assassinated by the orders of President Yuan Shikai. Song was the leader of the KMT who was to become prime minister following the party's victory in the 1912 elections. Yuan regularly flouted the elected assembly and assumed dictatorial powers. Upon his death in 1916, China disintegrated into warlordism and the Beiyang Government operating under the Constitution remained in the hands of various military leaders.\nThe Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek established control over much of China by 1928. The Nationalist Government promulgated the Provisional Constitution of the Political Tutelage Period on 5 May 1931. Under this document, the government operated under a one-party system with supreme power held by the National Congress of the Kuomintang and effective power held by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang. In Leninist fashion, it permitted a system of dual party-state committees to form the basis of government. The KMT intended this Constitution to remain in effect until the country had been pacified and the people sufficiently \"educated\" to participate in democratic government.\nDrafting process.\nThe constitution was first drafted by the Kuomintang (KMT) as part of its third stage of national development (i.e., representative democracy), it established a centralized republic with five branches of government. The constitution traces its origins to the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The impending outbreak of the Chinese Civil War pressured Chiang Kai-shek into enacting a democratic Constitution that would end KMT one-party rule. The Communists sought a coalition of one-third Nationalists, one-third Communists, and one-third other parties, to form a government that would draft the new Constitution. However, while rejecting this idea, the KMT and the CCP jointly held a convention at which both parties presented views. Amidst heated debate, many of the demands from the Communist Party were met, including the popular election of the Legislative Yuan. Together, these drafts are called the Constitutional Draft of the Political Convention (). Professor John Ching Hsiung Wu, Vice-chairman of the Constitution Drafting Commission, was the principal author of the text.\nThe Constitution, with minor revisions from the latest draft, was adopted by the National Constituent Assembly session on 25 December 1946, in Nanjing, promulgated by the National Government on 1 January 1947, and the fifth and current Chinese constitution officially went into effect on 25 December 1947. The Constitution was seen as the third and final stage of Kuomintang reconstruction of China. The Communists, though they attended the convention, and participated in drafting the constitution, boycotted the National Assembly and declared after the ratification that not only would they not recognize the ROC constitution, but all bills passed by the Nationalist administration would be disregarded as well. However, due to their showing in the election (approx. 800 out of 3045 seats,) their boycott did not prevent the Assembly from reaching quorum and thus electing Chiang Kai-shek and Lee Tsung-jen as president and vice president respectively. Zhou Enlai challenged the legitimacy of the National Assembly in 1947 by asserting that the KMT hand-picked its members 10 years earlier, and thus the Assembly could not be the legal representatives of the Chinese people.\nContent.\nThree Principles of the People.\nIn Article 1, the Republic of China is founded upon the Three Principles of the People (Chinese: \u4e09\u6c11\u4e3b\u7fa9; pinyin: \"S\u0101n M\u00edn Zh\u01d4y\u00ec\"), Minzu (\u6c11\u65cf), Minquan (\u6c11\u6b0a), and Minsheng (\u6c11\u751f), roughly defined as nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people. It establishes China as a \"democratic republic of the People, by the people, and for the people.\" Article 2 affirms that national sovereignty is derived from the citizenry. According to Article 3, people of ROC nationality are citizens of the Republic of China. Finally, Article 5 guarantees equality among the nations ethnic groups.\nCivil and political rights of people.\nThe basic civil rights and duties of the people are specified in Chapter 2 of the Constitution. Chapter 12 specifies four political rights of the people: election of public officials, recall of public officials, legislative initiative, and referendum.\nSeparation of Five Powers (Yuan).\nUnlike the typical division of governmental branches, the ROC constitution establishes a five-power, semi-parliamentary mode of constitutional governance. The five branches of government or Yuan (\u9662) include: the Executive Yuan (\u884c\u653f\u9662), the Legislative Yuan (\u7acb\u6cd5\u9662), the Judicial Yuan (\u53f8\u6cd5\u9662), the Examination Yuan (\u8003\u8a66\u9662), and the Control Yuan (\u76e3\u5bdf\u9662). The separation of five powers is predicated on revolutionary Sun Yat-sen's political theory. In 1906, Sun Yat-sen proposed the five-power system for China, adding the Examination Yuan and the Control Yuan to improve governmental efficiency and preclude corruption. Under this system, the Examination Yuan administers the selection of bureaucratic candidates whereas the Control Yuan monitors governmental integrity. Chapters 5-9 of the Constitution stipulates the authorities of the five Yuan. Should constitutional disputes arise between the Yuan, Article 44 authorizes the President to intervene with mediation sessions. This power, however, can be checked by the Yuan, who retain the ability to reject presidential calls for mediation.\nRacial groups in frontier regions.\nThe ideology of the Chinese Nationalist Party during the Xinhai Revolution was to create unity between the five traditional ethnic groups in China (Han, Manchus, Mongols, Hui (Muslims), and Tibetans) in order to stand up to European and Japanese imperialism as one, strong nation. The constitution has articles to protect the equality of different races and the political rights of racial groups in frontier regions. However, since some provinces similar to China proper have been created on Manchuria and Xinjiang. Only the protection of local autonomy in Inner and Outer Mongolia, and Tibet were regulated explicitly.\nDivisions of State Authority.\nThe National Assembly.\nBased on Sun Yat-sen's political theory, the ROC Constitution distinguishes political powers from governing powers, creating another dimension for checks and balances. The Constitution introduced a powerful authoritative legislative body\u2014the National Assembly (Chinese: \u570b\u6c11\u5927\u6703; pinyin: \"Gu\u00f3m\u00edn D\u00e0hu\u00ec\"), which exercised political powers derived from the people (Article 25). Thus, the National Assembly served to check national institutions with governing powers: the Presidency and the Five Yuan. Members of the National Assembly were directly elected by the people for six-year terms in open elections (Article 28). Under Article 27, the National Assembly had the right to amend the Constitution, exercise initiatives and referendums on the behalf of citizens, and elect or recall the President and the Vice President. Along with the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, the National Assembly featured parliamentary functions, sparking confusion around which institution served as the nation's parliament. The Legislative Yuan, National Assembly, and Control Yuan were all citizen-elected bodies; similarly, the National Assembly and Control Yuan exercised constitutional powers similar to powers granted to the legislative branch of Western constitutional governments. In 1957, the Constitutional Court ruled that the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Control Yuan were all \"equivalent to the parliaments of democratic nations\", creating a tripartite parliamentary system. Constitutional reforms of the 1990s later sought to condense the powers and functions of the three parliaments into one body. After gradually transferring powers to the Legislative Yuan, the National Assembly abolished itself in 2005.\nThe Presidency.\nThe President of the Republic of China (Chinese: \u7e3d\u7d71; pinyin: \"Z\u01d2ngt\u01d2ng\") is the head of state and the Commander-in-Chief of the Republic of China Armed Forces. Until 1996, the President and Vice President were elected by the National Assembly. After several rounds of constitutional revisions in the 1990s, the President became elected through universal free elections in 1996. Both the President and Vice President serve terms of four years and may be re-elected for an additional term. Originally, the ROC constitution drafted the president as a ceremonial figurehead presiding over a parliamentary republic: the President could grant amnesty and pardons (Article 40), confer honors and decorations (Article 42), issue emergency decrees (Article 43), and issue arbitration during disputes between multiple Yuan (Article 44). Other articles enumerated pertinent powers, permitting the President to declare war and make peace (Article 38), declare martial law with the approval of the Legislative Yuan (Article 39), and appoint or remove military officials (Article 41). However, a combination of the Chinese civil war and President Chiang Kai-shek's strong authoritarian impulses led to a dramatic expansion of presidential powers, shifting the ROC to a semi-presidential constitutional regime. In 1948, the National Assembly ratified the Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion, which superseded the Constitution by granting the President enhanced administrative and executive capabilities. Under the Temporary Provisions, the President was no longer obligated to gain the Legislative Yuan's approval when declaring martial law as stipulated in Article 39. Additionally, the President and the Vice President could disregard the two-term limit for re-election as described in Article 47. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek served five six-year terms (twenty-seven years) as president before his death in 1975. The Temporary Provisions would persist in Taiwan for forty-three years until it was repealed in 1991. Nonetheless, the role of the President remains constitutionally ambiguous even today.\nThe Executive Yuan.\nThe Executive Yuan (Chinese: \u884c\u653f\u9662; pinyin: \"X\u00edngzh\u00e8ngyu\u00e0n\") is the executive branch of the ROC government and is the \"highest administrative organ of the State.\" The President of the Executive Yuan is the Premier, who is appointed by the President of the Republic of China, and no longer requires consent from the Legislative Yuan. The Premier may be removed by a vote of no-confidence by a majority of the Legislative Yuan, after which the President may either remove the Premier or dissolve the Legislative Yuan and initiate a new election for legislators. Given the semi-presidential mode of constitutional governance, the Premier is the head of government while the President of the Republic is the head of state. Although the Premier is held accountable to the Legislative Yuan\u2014a common feature of parliamentary systems\u2014the presidential expansion of power has altered checks and balances between the branches of government; functionally, the Premier has become subordinate to the President.\nThe Executive Yuan Council, referred to as \"The Cabinet\" (Chinese: \u5167\u95a3; pinyin: N\u00e8ig\u00e9), is composed of a Premier, a Vice Premier, a certain number of Ministers and Chairmen of Commissions, and a certain number of Ministers without Portfolio (MWPs). Under Article 56, these cabinet members are appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the Premier. The Cabinet serves as the primary policy-making body of the executive branch, convening over administrative matters in weekly Cabinet meetings. Article 58 authorizes the Cabinet to assess statutory or budgetary bills concerning martial law or amnesty, declaration of war, conclusion of peace or treaties, and other affairs; the Cabinet subsequently submit bills to the Legislative Yuan. The Cabinet conducts decision-making through a single majority vote, which may be vetoed by the Premier. Additionally, the Cabinet presides over \"matters that are of common concern to the various Ministries and Commissions.\"\nThe Legislative Yuan.\nThe Legislative Yuan (Chinese: \u7acb\u6cd5\u9662; pinyin: \"L\u00ecf\u01ceyu\u00e0n\") is the unicameral legislature of the ROC government and is the \"highest legislative organ of the State.\" The Legislative Yuan is composed of 113 legislators, who are directly elected by voters through a parallel voting system for 4-year terms. Like parliaments in other countries, the Legislative Yuan passes legislation, which is later sent to the President for signing. The Legislative Yuan is led by a President and Vice President, who are elected by all members of the Yuan. The President of the Legislative Yuan then presides over Yuan sittings, periodic meetings of the Yuan.\nAccording to Chapter IV, the Executive Yuan is accountable to the Legislative Yuan. Article 63 empowers the Legislative Yuan to approve statutory or budgetary bills or bills sent by the Executive Yuan. Under Article 57, should the Legislative Yuan not concur with major policies of the Executive Yuan, \"it may, by resolution, request the Executive Yuan to alter such a policy.\" Then, the Executive Yuan must respond to this resolution and can request alterations to the bill. The Executive Yuan may also request the Legislative Yuan reconsider its resolution after gaining approval from the President of the Republic. If two-thirds of the Legislative Yuan uphold the original resolution after reconsideration, the Premier shall abide the resolution or resign from office.\nLocal governments: Provinces and Counties.\nIn Chapter XI of the Constitution, the country consists of two types of levels of local government: Provinces (first level, Section I) and Counties (second-level, Section II).\nA province is the first-level divisions of the country. It consists of 35 provinces, 1 special administrative region, 2 regions, 18 special municipalities, 14 leagues, and 4 special banners. According to Article 113, each provincial-level governments shall have a provincial council and governor with its members of the provincial council directly elected by the people of the province. Article 118 describes the self-government of municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. Articles 119 and 120 preserved the autonomy of Outer Mongolia and Tibet.\nCounties (also spelled as hsien) consists of second-level divisions under provinces with 2,035 counties, 56 province-controlled cities, 34 bureaus and 7 management bureaus with special municipalities and leagues consisting of districts and 127 banners. Articles 124 and 126 describes each county-level governments require a county council and magistrate with each member and magistrate shall be elected by the people within the county. In Article 127 a magistrate are heads of the local county self-government and shall administer matters delegated to the county by the central or provincial government.\nHowever, despite the major loss of its territory, even after democratization, the provinces began to be streamlined in 1998 with the counties and provincial cities governed directly under the Executive Yuan and the Tsai Ing-wen administration \"de facto\" suspended all provincial governments by 2018.\nSuspension of the constitution and martial law.\nImplementation of this constitution made China, then with a population of 450 million, the most populous \"paper democracy\". Though the Constitution was intended for the whole China, it was neither extensively nor effectively implemented as the KMT was already fully embroiled in a civil war with the Chinese Communist Party by the time of its promulgation.\nOn 10 January 1947, Governor Chen Yi announced that the new ROC Constitution would not apply to Taiwan after it went into effect in mainland China on 25 December 1947, as Taiwan was still under military occupation and also that Taiwanese were politically naive and were not capable of self-governing. Later that year, Chen Yi was dismissed and the Taiwan Provincial Government was established.\nOn 18 April 1948, the National Assembly added to the Constitution the \"Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion\". The Temporary Provisions came into force on 10 May 1948, ten days before the inauguration of the first President of the Republic of China. These articles greatly enhanced the power of the president and abolished the two term limit for the president and the vice president. Since December 7, 1949, the ROC only controls the \"free area of the Republic of China\", which is essentially Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, Pratas and Taiping Island, the only territories not lost to the Chinese Communists in the Chinese Civil War.\nFrom March 1947 until 1987, Taiwan was in a state of martial law. Although the constitution provided for regular democratic elections, these were not held in Taiwan until the 1990s. In 1954, the Judicial Yuan ruled that the delegates elected to the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan in 1947 would remain in office until new elections could be held in Mainland China which had come under the control of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949. This judicial ruling allowed the Kuomintang to rule unchallenged in Taiwan until the 1990s. In the 1970s, supplemental elections began to be held for the Legislative Yuan. Although these were for a limited number of seats, they did allow for the transition to a more open political system. In 1991, these members were ordered to resign by a subsequent Judicial Yuan ruling.\nDemocratisation.\nIn the late 1980s, the Constitution faced the growing democratisation on Taiwan combined with the mortality of the delegates that were elected in 1947. Faced with these pressures, on 22 April 1991, the first National Assembly voted itself out of office, abolished the Temporary Provisions passed in 1948, and adopted major amendments (known as the \"First Revision\") permitting free elections.\nOn 27 May 1992, several other amendments were passed (known as the \"Second Revision\"), most notably that allowing the direct election of the President of the Republic of China, Governor of Taiwan Province, and municipal mayors. Ten new amendments to replace the eighteen amendments of the First and Second Revisions were passed on 28 July 1994. The amendments passed in July 1997, streamlined the Taiwan Provincial Government and granted the Legislative Yuan powers of impeachment. The constitution was subsequently revised in 1999 and 2000, with the former revision being declared void the same year by the Council of Grand Justices. A further revision of the constitution happened in 2005 which disbanded the National Assembly, reformed the Legislative Yuan, and provided for future constitutional change to be ratified by referendum.\nPassing an amendment to the ROC constitution now requires an unusually broad political consensus, which includes approval from three-fourths of the quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan. This quorum requires at least three-fourths of all members of the Legislature. After passing the Legislature, the amendments need ratification by at least fifty percent of \"all eligible\" voters of the ROC \"irrespective\" of voter turnout.\nBecause the ROC constitution is, at least nominally, the constitution of \"all China\", the amendments avoided any specific reference to the Taiwan area and instead used the geographically neutral term \"Free Area of the Republic of China\" to refer to all areas under ROC control. All post-1991 amendments have been maintained as a separate part of the Constitution, consolidated into a single text of twelve articles.\nIssues.\nChallenge of legitimacy.\nA number of criticisms have been leveled at the constitution by supporters of Taiwan independence.\nUntil the 1990s when the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) joined the Kuomintang (KMT) in amending the constitution, the document was considered illegitimate by pro-independence advocates because it was not drafted in Taiwan; moreover, they deemed Taiwan to be sovereign Japanese territory until ceded in the San Francisco Peace Treaty effective 28 April 1952. Pro-independence advocates have argued that the Constitution was never legally applied to Taiwan because Taiwan was not formally incorporated into the ROC's territory through the National Assembly as per the specifications of Article 4. Though the constitution promulgated in 1946 did not define the territory of the Republic of China, while the draft of the constitution of 1925 individually listed the provinces of the Republic of China and Taiwan was not among them, since Taiwan was part of Japan as the result of the Treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895. The constitution also stipulated in the Article I.4, that \"the territory of the ROC is the original territory governed by it, unless authorized by the National Assembly, can not be altered.\" In 1946, Sun Fo, the minister of the Executive Yuan of ROC reported to the National Assembly that \"there are two types of territory changes: 1. renouncing territory and 2. annexing new territory. The first example would be the Independence of Mongolia, and the second example would be the reclamation of Taiwan. Both would be examples of territory changes. No such formal annexation of Taiwan islands by the ROC National Assembly conforming with the ROC constitution ever occurred since 1946, even though Article 9 of the says, \"The modifications of the functions, operations, and organization of the Taiwan Provincial Government may be specified by law.\" The Republic of China argues that sovereignty of the Republic of China over Taiwan was established by the Instrument of Surrender of Japan which implemented the Potsdam Declaration and the Cairo Declaration. The Allies have not agreed or disagreed to this rationale. In addition, the ROC argues that the Article 4 of 1952 Treaty of Taipei nullifies the Treaty of Shimonoseki and the original transfer of sovereignty of Taiwan from China to Japan. Since control of Taiwan occurred in 1945 before the promulgation of the 1947 constitution, the ROC government is of the view that a resolution by the National Assembly was unnecessary.\nWhile both symbolic and legal arguments have been used to discredit the application of the Constitution in Taiwan, the document gained more legitimacy among independence supporters throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s due to democratization and it is now accepted as the basic law of the ROC by all major parties, and considered the Constitution representing the sovereignty of Taiwan. However, there are proposals, particularly by supporters of Taiwan independence and the supporters of Taiwan localization movement, to replace the current Constitution with a document drafted by the Taiwanese constituencies in Taiwan.\nReferendums and constitutional reform.\nOne recent controversy involving the constitution is the right to referendum which is mentioned in the Constitution. The constitution states that \"The exercise of the rights of initiative and referendum shall be prescribed by law\", but legislation prescribing the practices had been blocked by the pan-blue coalition largely out of suspicions that proponents of a referendum law would be used to overturn the ROC Constitution and provide a means to declare Taiwan independence. A referendum law was passed on 27 November 2003 and signed by President Chen Shui-bian on 31 December 2003, but the law sets high standards for referendums such as the requirement that they can only be called by the President in times of imminent attack.\nIn 2003, President Chen Shui-bian proposed holding a referendum in 2006 for implementing an entirely new constitution on 20 May 2008, to coincide with the inauguration of the 12th-term president of the ROC. Proponents of such a move, namely the Pan-Green Coalition, argue that the current Constitution endorses a specific ideology (i.e., the Three Principles of the People), which is only appropriate for Communist states; in addition, they argue that a more \"efficient\" government is needed to cope with changing realities. Some proponents support replacing the five-branch structure outlined by the Three Principles of the People with a three-branch government. Others cite the current deadlock between the executive and legislative branches and support replacing the presidential system with a parliamentary system. Furthermore, the current Constitution explicitly states before the amendments implemented on Taiwan, \"To meet the requisites of the nation prior to national unification...\", in direct opposition to the pan-green position that Taiwan must remain separated from China. In response, the pan-blue coalition dropped its opposition to non-constitutional referendums and offered to consider through going constitutional reforms.\nThe proposal to implement an entirely new constitution met with strong opposition from the People's Republic of China and great unease from the United States, both of which feared the proposal to rewrite the constitution to be a veiled effort to achieve Taiwan independence, as it would sever a historic link to mainland China, and to circumvent Chen's original Four Noes and One Without pledge. In December 2003, the United States announced its opposition to any referendum that would tend to move Taiwan toward formal \"independence\", a statement that was widely seen as being directed at Chen's constitutional proposals.\nIn response, the Pan-Blue Coalition attempted to argue that a new constitution and constitutional referendums were unnecessary and that the inefficiencies in the ROC Constitution could be approved through the normal legislative process.\nIn his May 20, 2004, inaugural address, Chen called for a \"Constitutional Reform Committee\" to be formed by \"members of the ruling party and the opposition parties, as well as legal experts, academic scholars and representatives from all fields and spanning all social classes\" to decide on the proper reforms. He promised that the new Constitution would not change the issue of sovereignty and territory. This proposal went nowhere due to lack of cooperation from the opposition Pan-Blue.\nFormer President Ma Ying-jeou stated that constitutional reform was not a priority for his government."}

Since antiquity, Armenians have established communities in many regions throughout the world. However, the modern Armenian diaspora was largely formed as a result of World War I, when the Armenian genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire forced Armenians living in their homeland to flee or risk being killed. Another wave of emigration started with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\nTerminology.\nIn Armenian, the diaspora is referred to as spyurk (), spelled \u057d\u0583\u056b\u0582\u057c\u0584 in classical orthography and \u057d\u0583\u0575\u0578\u0582\u057c\u0584 in reformed orthography. In the past, the word gaghut (\u0563\u0561\u0572\u0578\u0582\u0569 ) was used mostly to refer to the Armenian communities outside the Armenian homeland. It is borrowed from the Aramaic (Classical Syriac) cognate of Hebrew \"galut\" (\u05d2\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea).\nHistory.\nThe Armenian diaspora has been present for over 1,700 years. The modern Armenian diaspora was formed largely after World War I as a result of the Armenian genocide. According to Randall Hansen, \"Both in the past and today, the Armenian communities around the world have developed in significantly different ways within the constraints and opportunities found in varied host cultures and countries.\"\nIn the fourth century, Armenian communities already existed outside of Greater Armenia. Diasporic Armenian communities emerged in the Achaemenid and Sassanid empires, and also to defend the eastern and northern borders of the Byzantine Empire. In order to populate the less populated areas of Byzantium, Armenians were relocated to those regions. Some Armenians converted to Greek Orthodoxy while retaining Armenian as their primary language, whereas others remained in the Armenian Apostolic Church despite pressure from official authorities. A growing number of Armenians migrated to Cilicia during the course of the eleventh and twelfth centuries as a result of the Seljuk Turk invasions. After the fall of the kingdom to the Mamelukes and loss of Armenian statehood in 1375, up to 150,000 went to Cyprus, the Balkans, and Italy. Although an Armenian diaspora existed during Antiquity and the Middle Ages, it grew in size due to emigration from the Ottoman Empire, Iran, Russia, and the Caucasus.\nThe Armenian diaspora is divided into two communities \u2013 those from Ottoman Armenia (or Western Armenia) and those who are from the former Soviet Union, the independent Armenia and Iran (or Eastern Armenia).\nArmenians of the modern Republic of Turkey do not consider themselves as part of the Armenian Diaspora, since they believe that they continue residing in their historical homeland.\nBefore 1870, there were 60 Armenian immigrants settled in New England. Armenian immigration rose to 1,500 by the end of the 1880s, and rose to 2,500 in the mid-1890s due to massacres caused by the Ottoman Empire. Armenians who immigrated to the United States before WWI were primarily from Asia Minor and settled on the East Coast.\nThe Armenian diaspora grew considerably during and after the First World War due to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. In the year 1910, over 5,500 Armenians immigrated to the United States, and by 1913, 9,355 more Armenians entered the North American borders. As World War I approached, the rate of Armenian immigration rose to about 60,000. In 1920 and until the Immigration Act of 1924, 30,771 Armenians came to the United States; the immigrants were predominantly widowed women, children, and orphans. Although many Armenians perished during the Armenian genocide, some of the Armenians who managed to escape, established themselves in various parts of the world. \nBy 1966, around 40 years after the start of the Armenian genocide, 2 million Armenians still lived in Armenia, while 330,000 lived in Russia, and 450,000 lived in the United States and Canada. \nThe immigration rate increased after the Immigration Act was liberated in 1965. Civil War in Lebanon in 1975 and the Islamic Revolution in Iran during 1978 were push factors for Armenians to immigrate. The 1980 U.S. Census reported 90 percent of immigration to the United States by Iranian-Armenians occurred during the years 1975 and 1980.\nDistribution.\nLess than one third of the world's Armenian population lives in Armenia. Their pre-World War I population area was six times larger than that of present-day Armenia, including the eastern regions of Turkey, northern part of Iran, and the southern part of Georgia.\nBy 2000, there were 7,580,000 Armenians living abroad in total."}

He won a world championship on four occasions in two weight classes, having held the WBO light heavyweight title from 1988 to 1991; compiling 22 straight KOs in 22 fights and the WBO heavyweight title from 1992 to 1993; the unified WBA, IBF and lineal heavyweight titles in 1994; and regained the IBF heavyweight title again from 1996 to 1997 becoming a three-time heavyweight world champion.\nMichael Moorer was an undefeated southpaw in his first 35 professional bouts. He captured the WBO light heavyweight title in 1988 which he defended 9 times. In 1991, Moorer moved up to Heavyweight winning the vacant WBO heavyweight title from Bert Cooper via TKO in 1992. He went on to defeat Evander Holyfield for the unified WBA, IBF and lineal heavyweight titles in 1994. He remains the only southpaw to win the lineal world championship at heavyweight and the only light heavyweight world champion to win a heavyweight world title on more than one occasion.\nMoorer is only one of four boxers over the last century that has ever won a version of a world title at both light heavyweight and heavyweight along with Roy Jones Jr., Michael Spinks, and James Toney.\nSince retiring from the sport, Moorer has worked as a boxing trainer. In 2009, he worked alongside Freddie Roach at the Wild Card gym in Los Angeles.\nAmateur career.\nMoorer was born in Brooklyn and raised in the small town of Monessen, Pennsylvania. From an early age, Moorer began playing football and was raised by a single mother, who noticed Moorer's unusual hyperactivity. At age 10, Moorer's grandfather, a former New York Golden Gloves Champion who sparred with greats such as Archie Moore, encouraged Moorer to begin training at age 11. Moorer is naturally right-handed, but fought the entirety of his career as a southpaw. Moorer graduated from Monessen High School in 1987, where he starred in football as a linebacker and tight end.\nAs his amateur career developed, Moorer moved to Detroit, Michigan to train with the legendary Emanuel Steward. In 1986, Moorer was a National Champion for the 156 lb (light middleweight) weight class. At Steward's Kronk Gym, Moorer was known for beating professionals while still an amateur. Moorer also won a bronze medal at the Goodwill Games, and finished his amateur career with a record of 48\u201316.\nProfessional career.\nLight heavyweight.\nMoorer had a fast rise through the professional boxing ranks. He debuted on March 4, 1988, knocking out Adrian Riggs in the first round. Before the year's end, he was undefeated in eleven bouts (winning all by way of early round knockouts) and fighting for the world title for the first time. He acquired the newly created WBO light heavyweight title with a five-round knockout of Ramzi Hassan.\nIn 1989, he retained the title six times, beating Freddie Delgado, Frankie Swindell, Mike Sedillo and former WBA champion Leslie Stewart, among others.\nIn 1990, he retained the title three times before the end of the year, beating Mario Melo and former Michael Spinks challenger Jim McDonald, among others.\nHeavyweight.\n1991 saw Moorer move up to the heavyweight division. He rolled through the competition en route to securing an opportunity to fight for the vacant WBO heavyweight championship the following year against Bert Cooper. Moorer stopped Cooper in the fifth round after both fighters were down and hurt during the bout.\nHe did not defend the then-lesser regarded WBO heavyweight belt. Moorer and trainer Emanuel Steward parted ways after the Cooper fight. Moorer eventually joined Lou Duva's team, and was trained by Georgie Benton for three fights in 1993, including a 10-round decision win over former champion James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith.\nMoorer then parted ways with the Duvas and Benton, and hired New York-based trainer Teddy Atlas in late 1993. Moorer closed the year with a ten-round decision over Mike Evans.\nUnified heavyweight champion.\nOn April 22, 1994, Moorer challenged Evander Holyfield for the lineal, IBF, and WBA title belts. In round 2 Holyfield sent Moorer down on the canvas, but Moorer overcame and went on to win a majority decision. As a result, he became the first-ever southpaw heavyweight champion.\nIn his first defense of those belts, on November 5, 1994, Moorer faced 45-year-old George Foreman, who lost his last fight for the vacant WBO heavyweight title to Tommy Morrison. For nine rounds, Moorer easily outboxed him, hitting and moving away, while Foreman moving forward, seemingly unable to \"pull the trigger\" on his punches. Moorer was ahead on all three judges' scorecards entering the 10th round, when Foreman hit him with a number of long-range jabs. Then, suddenly, a short right hand caught Moorer square on his chin, gashing open his bottom lip, and he collapsed to the canvas. Moorer was knocked out and lost the world championship. He also lost his undefeated record. Foreman, at age 45, became the oldest fighter ever to win the world heavyweight title.\nThe following year, Moorer re-grouped by winning against fringe contender Melvin Foster. Meanwhile, Foreman retained the title with a close and controversial decision against German fighter Axel Schulz.\nBecause of the controversial nature of the Foreman-Schulz bout, the IBF ordered Foreman to travel to Germany for a rematch, but Foreman refused, choosing to leave the IBF belt vacant instead. South African Francois Botha travelled to Germany instead and beat Schulz with another close decision to claim the title, but he was stripped of it when he tested positive for illegal substances shortly after.\nThird heavyweight title reign.\nMoorer was then given the opportunity to fight Schulz for the vacant crown in Berlin. On June 22, 1996, Moorer won the IBF heavyweight crown once again, beating Schulz by a 12-round split decision.\nHe became a three-time heavyweight champion; WBO (1992), WBA/IBF (1994) and IBF (1996\u20131997). When Moorer held the WBO heavyweight title, it wasn't considered an authentic heavyweight title. Ironically, Moorer has always been recognized as a former light heavyweight champion despite only ever holding the WBO title at that weight.\nMoorer's first defense came against Botha on November 9, 1996. In a brutal one-sided bout, Moorer, leading on the cards going into the 12th, ended with a flourish, knocking Botha out 18 seconds into the final round.\nIn March 1997, Moorer retained his belt with a 12-round decision over previously undefeated Vaughn Bean before parting ways with trainer Teddy Atlas, with whom he'd been experiencing increasing tension since the beginning of their professional relationship. He replaced him with Freddie Roach.\nHolyfield vs. Moorer II.\nOn November 8, Moorer lost his IBF title in a unification match with WBA champion Evander Holyfield. Moorer was knocked down five times before ringside doctor Flip Homansky advised referee Mitch Halpern to stop the bout in round eight.\nComeback.\nAfter this, he retired from boxing for three years before returning with a knockout of journeyman Lorenzo Boyd. Moorer had begun drinking heavily and weighed 270 pounds. During his comeback, he won three more fights, then seemingly retired again when he was knocked out only 30 seconds into round one by David Tua on August 17, 2002. However, he returned to the ring once again on March 29, 2003, beating Otis Tisdale on points over ten rounds. On August 23, 2003, he beat Brazil's Rodolfo Lobo by knockout in only 64 seconds.\nAfter a layoff of almost a year, he returned on July 3, 2004, losing a ten-round unanimous decision to Eliseo Castillo in Miami, Florida. In December of that year, Moorer rallied from a severe deficit on the scorecards to hand former cruiserweight champion Vassiliy Jirov his first knockout loss. He continued fighting, winning all of his bouts against limited opposition. His last fight was a KO win over Shelby Gross in 2008. Following the fight, Moorer retired from professional boxing.\nPersonal life.\nMoorer was arrested in 1989 for taking part in a brawl in Charleroi, Pennsylvania.\nIn 1991, just days after his win over Alex Stewart, Moorer was arrested for assaulting a police officer. Moorer had reportedly been intoxicated at the time of his arrest. The officer he punched suffered a broken jaw. Moorer later was placed on probation and settled the case out of court."}

The forest wagtail belongs to the monotypic genus \"Dendronanthus\" which is closely related to \"Motacilla\" and sometimes included therein. The common name and genus names are derived from their characteristic tail pumping behaviour. Together with the pipits and longclaws they form the family Motacillidae.\nThe willie wagtail (\"Rhipidura leucophrys\") of Australia is an unrelated bird similar in coloration and shape to the Japanese wagtail. It belongs to the fantails.\nTaxonomy.\nThe genus \"Motacilla\" was introduced by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his \"Systema Naturae\". The type species is the white wagtail. \"Motacilla\" is the Latin name for the pied wagtail; although actually a diminutive of \"motare\", \"to move about\", from medieval times it led to the misunderstanding of \"cilla\" as \"tail\".\nAt first glance, the wagtails appear to be divided into a yellow-bellied group and a white-bellied one, or one where the upper head is black and another where it is usually grey, but may be olive, yellow, or other colours. However, these are not evolutionary lineages; change of belly colour and increase of melanin have occurred independently several times in the wagtails, and the colour patterns which actually indicate relationships are more subtle.\nmtDNA cytochrome \"b\" and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data (Voelker, 2002) is of limited use: the suspicion that there is a superspecies of probably three white-bellied, black-throated wagtails is confirmed. Also, there is another superspecies in sub-Saharan Africa, three white-throated species with a black breast-band. The remaining five species are highly variable morphologically and their relationships with each other and with the two clades have not yet been satisfactorily explained.\nThe origin of the genus appears to be in the general area of Eastern Siberia/Mongolia. Wagtails spread rapidly across Eurasia and dispersed to Africa in the Zanclean (Early Pliocene)\nwhere the sub-Saharan lineage was later isolated. The African pied wagtail (and possibly the Mekong wagtail) diverged prior to the massive radiation of the white-bellied black-throated and most yellow-bellied forms, all of which took place during the late Piacenzian (early Late Pliocene), c. 3 mya.\nThree species are poly- or paraphyletic in the present taxonomical arrangement and either subspecies need to be reassigned and/or species split up. The blue-headed wagtail (AKA yellow wagtail and many other names), especially, has always been a taxonomical nightmare with over a dozen currently accepted subspecies and many more invalid ones. The two remaining \"monochrome\" species, Mekong and African pied wagtail may be closely related, or a most striking example of convergent evolution.\nPrehistoric wagtails known from fossils are \"Motacilla humata\" and \"Motacilla major\".\nCharacteristics.\nWagtails are slender, often colourful, ground-feeding insectivores of open country in the Old World. Species of wagtail breed in Africa, Europe and Asia, some of which are fully or partially migratory. Two species also breed in Alaska, and wintering birds may reach Australia.\nThey are ground nesters, laying up to six speckled eggs at a time. Among their most conspicuous behaviours is a near constant tail wagging, a trait that has given the birds their common name. In spite of the ubiquity of the behaviour and observations of it, the reasons for it are poorly understood. It has been suggested that it may flush up prey, or that it may signal submissiveness to other wagtails. Recent studies have suggested instead that it is a signal of vigilance that may aid to deter potential predators.\nSpecies list.\nThe genus contains 13 species.\nFormer species in this genus.\nFormerly, some authorities also considered the following species (or subspecies) as species within the genus \"Motacilla\":"}

Northern states are divided into small numbers of large municipalities (e.g. Amazonas is divided into only 62 municipalities), and therefore they cover large areas incorporating several separated cities or towns that do not necessarily conform to one single conurbation. Southern and eastern states on the other hand, are divided into many small municipalities (e.g. Minas Gerais is divided into 853 municipalities), and therefore large urban areas usually extend over several municipalities which form one single conurbation.\nThe Federal District cannot be divided into municipalities, which is why its territory is composed of several administrative regions. These regions are directly managed by the government of the Federal District, which exercises constitutional and legal powers that are equivalent to those of the states, as well as those of the municipalities, thus simultaneously assuming all the obligations arising from them.\nThe 1988 Brazilian Constitution treats the municipalities as parts of the Federation and not simply dependent subdivisions of the states. Each municipality has an autonomous local government, comprising a mayor (\"prefeito\") and a legislative body called municipal chamber (\"c\u00e2mara municipal\"). Both the local government and the legislative body are directly elected by the population every four years. These elections take place at the same time all over the country; the last municipal elections were held on 15 November 2020. Each municipality has the constitutional power to approve its own laws, as well as collecting taxes and receiving funds from the state and federal governments. However, municipal governments have no judicial power per se, and courts are only organised at the state or federal level. A subdivision of the state judiciary, or \"comarca\", can either correspond to an individual municipality or encompass several municipalities.\nThe seat of the municipal administration is a nominated city (\"cidade\"), with no specification in the law about the minimum population, area or facilities. The city always has the same name as the municipality, as they are not treated as distinct entities. Municipalities can be subdivided, only for administrative purposes, into districts (normally, new municipalities are formed from these districts). Other populated sites are villages, but with no legal effect or regulation. Almost all municipalities are subdivided into neighbourhoods (\"bairros\"), although most municipalities do not officially define their neighbourhood limits (usually small cities in the countryside).\nMunicipalities can be split or merged to form new municipalities within the borders of the state, if the population of the involved municipalities expresses a desire to do so in a plebiscite. However, these must abide by the Brazilian Constitution, and forming exclaves or seceding from the state or union is expressly forbidden."}

From 936 to 1531, the Palatine Chapel saw the coronation of thirty-one German kings and twelve queens. The church has been the mother church of the Diocese of Aachen since 1930. In 1978, Aachen Cathedral was one of the first 12 items to be listed on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites, because of its exceptional artistry, architecture, and central importance in the history of the Holy Roman Empire.\nHistory.\nCharlemagne began the construction of the Palatine Chapel around 796, along with the rest of the palace structures. The construction is credited to Odo of Metz. The exact date of completion is unclear; however, a letter from Alcuin, in 798, states that it was nearing completion, and in 805, Pope Leo III consecrated the finished chapel. A foundry was brought to Aachen near the end of the 8th century and was utilized to cast multiple bronze pieces, from doors and the railings, to the horse and bear statues. Charlemagne was buried in the chapel in 814. It suffered a large amount of damage in a Viking raid in 881, and was restored in 983.\nFollowing Charlemagne's canonization by Antipope Paschal III in 1165, the chapel became a draw for pilgrims. Due to the enormous flow of pilgrims, in 1355 a Gothic choir hall was added, and a two-part Capella vitrea (glass chapel) was consecrated on the 600th anniversary of Charlemagne's death. A cupola, several other chapels, and a steeple were also constructed at later dates. It was restored again in 1881, when the Baroque stucco was removed.\nDuring World War II, Aachen, including its famed cathedral, was heavily damaged by Allied bombing attacks and artillery fire, but the cathedral's basic structure survived. Many of the cathedral's artistic objects had been removed to secure storage during the war, and some which could not be moved were protected within the church itself. However, the glazing of the 14th-century choir hall, the Neo-Gothic altar, a large part of the cloister, and the Holiness Chapel (\"Heiligtumskapelle\") were irretrievably destroyed. Reconstruction and restoration took place intermittently over more than 30 years, and cost an estimated \u20ac40 Million.\nStructure.\nThe cathedral uses two distinct architectural styles, with small portions of a third. First, the core of the cathedral is the Carolingian-Romanesque Palatine Chapel, which was modeled after San Vitale at Ravenna and is notably small in comparison to the later additions. Secondly, the choir was constructed in the Gothic style. Finally, there are portions that show Ottonian style, such as the area around the throne.\nCarolingian Octagon (Palatine chapel).\nThe octagon in the centre of the cathedral was erected as the chapel of the Palace of Aachen between 796 and 805 on the model of other contemporary Byzantine buildings (e.g. the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna and the Little Hagia Sophia in Constantinople). The architect was Odo of Metz, and the original design was of a domed octagonal inner room enveloped by a 16 sided outer wall. The span and height of Charlemagne's Palatine chapel was unsurpassed north of the Alps for over two hundred years.\nThe Palatine chapel consisted of a high octagonal room with a two-story circuit below. The inner octagon, with a diameter of , is made up of strong piers, on which an octagonal cloister vault lies, covering the central room. Around this inner octagon is a sixteen sided circuit of low groin vaults, supporting a high gallery above. This upper story was known as the \"Hochm\u00fcnster\" (high church). The arched openings of the lower story are only about half as high as those of the \"Hochm\u00fcnster\", as a result of which the lower story looks stocky and bulky. The two floors are separated from each other by an expansive cornice. The high altar and Imperial throne are located on the upper circuit of the Palatine chapel in an octagonal side room, covered by a barrel vault lying on an angle. This area was connected to the palace by a passage. Above the arches of the gallery, an octagonal drum with window openings rises, on top of which is the cupola. On the east end was a small apse that protruded and was, in later years, replaced by the choir. Opposite of this, was the tiered entrance to the rest of the now defunct palace, Westwork. Light is brought in by a three tiered system of circular arched windows. The corners of the octagonal dome are joined with the walls with a system of paired pilasters with corinthian capitals.\nThe upper gallery openings are divided by a grid of columns. These columns are ancient and come from St. Gereon in Cologne. Charlemagne allowed further spolia to be brought to Aachen from Rome and Ravenna at the end of the 8th century. In 1794, during the French occupation of the Rheinland, they were removed to Paris, but in 1815 up to half the pieces remaining in the Louvre were brought back to Aachen. In the 1840s they were restored to their original places once more and new columns of Odenberg granite were substituted for the missing columns. The interior walls were initially lined with a marble facade. The round arched openings in the upper floor in the side walls of the octagon, between the columns, in front of a mezzanine, are decorated with a metre-high railing of Carolingian bronze rails. These bronze rails were cast 1200 years ago in a single piece according to Roman models. The original cupola mosaic was probably executed around 800 and known from Medieval sources depicted Christ as the triumphant lord of the world, surrounded by the symbols of the Four Evangelists, with the twenty-four elders from the Apocalypse of John offering their crowns to him. In 1880-81 it was recreated by the Venetian workshop of Antonio Salviati, according to the plans of the Belgian architect Jean-Baptiste de B\u00e9thune. The dome was intricately decorated with a mosaic tile.\nThe exterior walls of the Carolingian octagon, made of quarry stone, are largely unjointed and lack further ornamentation. The only exception is that the projections of the pillars of the cupola are crowned by antique capitals. Above the Carolingian masonry, there is a Romanesque series of arches above a late Roman gable. The Octagon is crowned by unusual baroque vents.\nAachen Cathedral was plastered red in the time of Charlemagne, according to the most recent findings of the Rheinish Office for Monuments. This plaster was made longer-lasting through the addition of crushed red brick. The colour was probably also a reference to the imperial associations of the work.\nGeometry.\nThe question of which geometric concepts and basic dimensions lie at the basis of the chapel's construction is not entirely clear even today. Works of earlier cathedral architects mostly followed either the Drusian foot (334 mm) or the Roman foot (295.7 mm). However, these measurements require complex theories to explain the church's actual dimensions. In 2012, the architectural historian Ulrike Heckner proposed a theory of a new, hitherto unknown unit of measure of 322.4\u00a0mm, the so-called Carolingian foot, to which all other measurements in the Palatine chapel can be traced back. This measurement is referred to as the \"Aachener K\u00f6nigsfu\u00df\" (Aachen royal foot), after the similarly sized Parisian royal foot (324.8\u00a0mm).\nBeyond this, there is a symbolic layer to the octagon. Eight was a symbol of the eighth day (Sunday as the sabbath) and therefore symbolised the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal life. Likewise, ten, the number of perfection in Medieval architectural symbolism, is frequent in the Palatine Chapel: Its diameter (including the circuit surrounding the dome) measures a hundred Carolingian feet (i. e. ten by ten) \u2013 equivalent to the height of the dome.\nWestwork.\nThe westwork (western facade) of the cathedral is of Carolingian origin, flanked by two stair-towers. It is a two-story building, completed by a porch from the 18th century at the west end.\nThe bronze leaves attached to this porch, the \"Wolfst\u00fcr\" (Wolf's Door), weigh 43 hundredweight altogether (cf. with this the Lousberg saga). The main entrance to the cathedral, the door was cast in Aachen around 800 and was located between the westwork and the octagon in the so-called hexadecagon up to 1788. The portal was restored in 1924. Each leaf is divided into eight rectangles \u2013 a number which had religious symbolism in Christianity, as a symbol of Sunday, the day of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and also of perfection (as did twelve, also) and can be found in the measurements of the Palatine Chapel over and over again. These boxes were framed by decorative strips, which are made of egg-shaped decorations. The egg was considered a symbol of life and fertility from antiquity. In Christian belief it was imbued with the even wider symbolism of Eternal Life. The door-rings in the shape of lions' heads are wreathed by 24 (i.e. two times twelve or three times eight) acanthus scrolls \u2013 again to be understood at the deepest level through numerology. The Wolfst\u00fcr's imitation of the shape of the ancient Roman temple door signifies Charlemagne's claim, to have established a New Rome in Aachen with the Palatine Chapel as the distinctive monumental building.\nThere were multiple sculptures, made of bronze, including an equestrian piece probably meant as a parallel of a statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. In the forehall, there is a bronze sculpture of a bear, which was probably made in the 10th century, i.e. in Ottonian times. Opposite it is a bronze pine cone with 129 perforated scales, which stands 91\u00a0cm high (including its base); its date is controversial and ranges from the 3rd to the 10th century. Its base is clearly Ottonian and includes an inscription written in dactylic hexameter, which refers to the Tigris and Euphrates rivers of Mesopotamia. According to one view, the pine cone would originally have served as a waterspout on a fountain and would have been placed in the atrium of the Palatine chapel in Carolingian times.\nThe upper level is characterised by an exceptionally fine brick western wall. Inside, it bulges outward, while the outside bulges inwards, so that the Carolingian west wall can be seen as a convex-concave bulge. Before the construction of the porch in the 18th century, the Carolingian west facade, when seen from the Narthex, was particularly evocative: a large niche, topped by a semicircular arch in the western upper level corresponded to the semicircle of the barrel vault of the lower level.\nToday, the western wall is broken up by the large western window. The large window frame dates from the Gothic period and replaced a smaller window from Carolingian times, which was probably structured as a mullion (a double arch with a column in the centre). The modern window was designed by Ewald Matar\u00e9 in 1956. Matar\u00e9's design imitates, however abstractly, the structure of the Carolingian bronze gate inside the dome. Bronze and unprocessed quartz form the window itself.\nThe function of the upstairs part of the west facade is not entirely clear. The right of baptism (long reserved for the Collegiate Church of Mary) was at a baptismal font, which was behind the marble throne, until the end of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\". Possibly the space was involved in these ceremonies. Furthermore, in the western wall, under the great west window, there is a \"Fensetella\" (small window) even today, through which there is line of sight to the court below, the former atrium. It is certain that the so-called \"Carolingian Passage\" entered this room on its northern wall, connecting the Aula Regia (King's Hall) in the north of the palace with the church.\nThe lower, barrel-vaulted room in the west probably served as Charlemagne's sepulchre after his death on 28 January 814 and his burial in the Persephone sarcophagus.\nThe floors of the western facade lying above this room were remodelled in the first half of the 14th century and in the 17th century; the tower was completed between 1879 and 1884.\nChoir.\nBetween 1355 and 1414, on the initiative of the Marienstift and the mayor of Aachen Gerhard Chorus (1285\u20131367), a Gothic Choir was built to the east of the Octagon. Before this there must have been a rectangular Carolingian choir.\nThe Gothic choir measures 25m in length, 13m wide and 32m high. Its external wall is broken, as much as possible, by windows \u2013 the surface area of the glass is more than 1,000m\u00b2 and led to the name \"Glashaus\" (glass house). This was conceived as a glass reliquary for the holy relics of Aachen and for the body of Charlemagne. The design is arranged on the model of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, likewise a space for important relics and a royal palace chapel. For protection of the vault of the choir, iron rods were built in at the time of construction, to counter the lateral force on the narrow stone supports and to allow as much space as possible between them for window space.\nSide chapels.\nGathered around the octagon are several side chapels. Clockwise from the southeast, they are:\nNotable items.\nAachen Cathedral houses a collection of medieval art objects from the late Classical, Carolingian, Ottonian and Staufian periods which are exceptional in their artistic and religious meaning.\nThrone of Charlemagne.\nIn the western gallery on the lower floor, opposite the choir, the Throne of Charlemagne is to be found, which has been the object of new investigations in the past decades. The original Carolingian throne came from the spolia of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The appearance of the throne and its location in the Palatine Chapel did not change with the passage of centuries. Between 936 and 1531, thirty one German kings ascended to this throne after their anointment and coronation at the Marienaltar (Altar of Mary). \nMarienschrein.\nThe \"Marienschrein\" (Shrine of St. Mary) rests in the choir of the church and dates from 1220 to 1239. Adorned with the figures of Christ, Mary, Charlemagne, Pope Leo III and the Twelve Apostles, the shrine contains the four great Aachen relics: St. Mary's cloak, Christ's swaddling clothes, St. John the Baptist's beheading cloth and Christ's loincloth. Following a custom begun in 1349, every seven years the relics are taken out of the shrine and put on display during the Great Aachen Pilgrimage. This pilgrimage most recently took place during June 2014.\nBarbarossa chandelier.\nFrom the vault of the dome, which is made up of eight curved faces, a wheel chandelier hangs on a long chain, about four metres above the ground, with a diameter of over four metres, which is known as the Barbarossa Chandelier (1165/1170). This artwork was a donation of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and his wife Beatrice. The forty-eight candles of the chandelier are lit for solemnities of the Church.\nAmbon of Henry II. (Heinrichskanzel).\nBetween 1002 and 1014, Henry II had a pulpit erected as an ambon in the east passage, which is among the most magnificent artistic treasures of the Ottonian Renaissance. Its inscription on the upper and lower edges clearly identifies its donor as Henry II, referring to him as \"REX PIVS HEINRICVS\". The pulpit is made of an oak base and is decorated all over with filigree and precious stones, with many precious artefacts from antiquity, such as four repouss\u00e9 copper reliefs with depictions of the Evangelists, as well as six ivory panels of the 6th century. The wooden staircase dates to 1782. The Ambon was thoroughly restored in 1816/1817 and again between 1926 and 1937. To this day, the pulpit is still in liturgical use for solemnities of the Church.\nPala d'Oro.\nA golden altarpiece, the Pala d'Oro which today forms the Antependium of the high altar was probably created around 1020 in Fulda. It consists of seventeen individual gold panels with reliefs in repouss\u00e9. In the centre, Christ is enthroned as Redeemer in a Mandorla, flanked by Mary and the Archangel Michael. Four round medallions with images of the Evangelists' symbols show the connection to the other twelve relief panels with depictions from the life of Jesus Christ. They begin with the entry into Jerusalem and end with the encounter of the women with the risen Christ in front of the open grave on Easter morning. The depictions are read from left to right, like a book.\nStylistically, the Pala d'Oro is not uniform. The first five reliefs probably come from a goldsmith taught in the Rheinland and is distinguished by a strikingly joyful narration. It probably derives from a donation of Emperor Otto III. The other panels, together with the central group of Christ, Mary, and Michael, draws from Byzantine and late Carolingian predecessors and was likely first added under Otto's successor, Henry II, who also donated the Ambo of Henry II.\nPresumably, in the late 15th century, the golden altarpiece formed a massive altar system together with the twelve reliefs of apostles in the cathedral treasury, along with altarpieces with scenes from the life of Mary, which would have been dismantled in 1794 as the French Revolutionary troops approached Aachen.\nTreasury.\nThe Aachen cathedral treasury includes highly important objects including the Cross of Lothair, Bust of Charlemagne and the Persephone sarcophagus. The Cathedral Treasury in Aachen is regarded as one of the most important ecclesiastical treasuries in northern Europe. Pilgrims are able to see some of the relics every seven years when they are displayed.\nOrgans.\nThe organ system of Aachen Cathedral was installed in 1939. It consists in part of the earlier organ, installed 1845\u20131847, which was built by the organ builder Wilhelm Korfmacher of Linnich. This \"Korfmacher\" organ had 60 stops, distributed in three works.\nThe current instrument was installed in 1939 by Johannes Klais (Bonn) and expanded to 65 stops, which were distributed thereafter in five works. To achieve a balanced sound throughout the cathedral, the parts were distributed through the cathedral: in the northwest and southwest niches of the choir are the works of the High organ, while a swallow's nest organ was hung on the east pillar of the octagon.\nIn 1991\u20131993, the organ was restored by the Klais organ company and increased to a total of 89 stops. At this time the swallow's nest organ was turned into a new, independent instrument, which now stands in the upper church, between the octagon and the choir.\nAs well as a chamber organ, the cathedral also has a small organ, called the \"Zoboli Organ\". This was built by the north Italian organ builder, Cesare Zomboli, probably some time around 1850. The pipeworks, windbox, and keyboard survive. The historic housing no longer exists, but the current housing was built later on the model of a north Italian cabinet organ in classicist style. The instrument is arranged in the classic Italian style, with the typical stops of the Roman style as well.\nBells.\nIn the belfry of the tower, eight bells hang on wooden yokes in a wooden bell frame. The bells were cast three years after the city fire of 1656 by Franz Von Trier and his son Jakob. This disposition, altered from that of Medieval times, has been maintained to this day, except that the Marybell has had to be replaced twice. The modern Marybell was made in 1958 and was cast by Petit &amp; Gebr. Edelbrock.\nHistorical and religious significance.\nFinal resting place of Charlemagne.\nThe core of Aachen Cathedral, the Carolingian octagon, was originally erected as Charlemagne's palace chapel and was also his grave. After his death, on 28 January 814, he was buried in his church; the exact spot is unknown, because of the lack of documentation and the ambiguity of the physical evidence. However, it is probable that he was buried in the Persephone sarcophagus under the west tower at the entrance to the octagon.\nIn 1000, Otto III had Charlemagne's vault opened. Otto of Lomello, one of the courtiers who accompanied him, recorded the event, which is reported in the Chronicle of Novalesia, written about 1026. The account reads:\nA large picture representing Otto and his nobles gazing on the dead Emperor was painted on the wall of the great room in Aachen Town Hall.\nIn 1165, on the occasion of Charlemagne's canonisation, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa again opened the vault and reinterred his remains. In 1215, at his coronation, Frederick II had the remains reinterred for the last time, placing them in a casket of gold and silver, known as the Karlsschrein, where they remain to this day.\nEmperor Otto III was buried in the cathedral as well.\nCoronation church of German kings.\nOn the explicit instructions of Charlemagne, his son Louis the Pious crowned himself king in the chapel. Between the coronation of Otto I in 936 and 1531, thirty German kings (out of ~40) were crowned in the chapel. The coronation itself occurred at the High Altar, followed by the enthronement on the Aachen Throne of Charlemagne (which can still be seen today). It is also notable that in this period, all German rulers, regardless of whether they were crowned in Aachen or not, took their position on Charlemagne's throne.\nAachen pilgrimage.\nThe Aachen pilgrimage (\"Aachener Heiligtumsfahrt\"), a pilgrimage during which the four most important religious relics of the cathedral can be seen by believers, is attested from 1238. Since 1349, these relics have been displayed once every seven years. The last pilgrimage was in 2014, and had the motto \"Geh in das Land, das ich dir zeigen werde\" (\"Go to the land I will show you\"; cf. ).\nInfluence.\nAs early as the Middle Ages, Aachen Cathedral was admired and imitated, as in the case of Essen Minster, the Old Tower in Mettlach and in the Alsatian Abbey Church of Ottmarsheim. Construction elements of the octagon and choir were nominated as Historic landmarks of German civil engineering in 2007.\nLegend.\nAccording to legend, the people of Aachen ran out of funding to finish the construction of the cathedral. It is said that they made a deal with the devil to obtain the remaining funds, in exchange for the soul of the first to enter the cathedral. Upon completion, the locals sent a wolf into the cathedral and the devil quickly took the animal's soul. Upon realizing the trick, the devil stormed from the cathedral, severing his thumb in the lion head door handles. A wolf statue sits in the entrance to the cathedral, and the \"devil's thumb\" can be felt inside the lion's mouth.\nMiscellaneous.\nThe German impressionist painter August von Brandis painted Aachen Cathedral in several works. Act III of Giuseppe Verdi's \"Ernani\" is set at the tomb of Charlemagne.\nThe \"Domwache\" (Cathedral watch), a youth self-help group, has been operated since 1957 by the Catholic students association of K.D.St.V. Franconia Aachen.\nSince November 15th 2012, the Geological Service of North Rhine-Westphalia operates a station monitoring seismic activity in the Lower Rhine Basin. It is located in the foundations of the hexadecagon near the entry to the St Ann's Chapel."}

Cities are ranked on the same level as and , with the difference that they are not a component of . Like other contemporary administrative units, they are defined by the Local Autonomy Law of 1947.\nCity status.\nArticle 8 of the Local Autonomy Law sets the following conditions for a municipality to be designated as a city:\nThe designation is approved by the prefectural governor and the Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications.\nA city can theoretically be demoted to a town or village when it fails to meet any of these conditions, but such a demotion has not happened to date. The least populous city, Utashinai, Hokkaido, has a population of three thousand, while a town in the same prefecture, Otofuke, Hokkaido, has over forty thousand.\nUnder the , the standard of 50,000 inhabitants for the city status has been eased to 30,000 if such population is gained as a result of a merger of towns and/or villages, in order to facilitate such mergers to reduce administrative costs. Many municipalities gained city status under this eased standard. On the other hand, the municipalities recently gained the city status purely as a result of increase of population without expansion of area are limited to those listed in List of former towns or villages gained city status alone in Japan.\nClassifications for large cities.\nThe Cabinet of Japan can designate cities of at least 200,000 inhabitants to have the status of core city, or designated city. These statuses expand the scope of administrative authority delegated from the prefectural government to the city government.\nStatus of Tokyo.\nTokyo, Japan's capital, existed as a city until 1943, but is now legally classified as a special type of prefecture called a . The 23 special wards of Tokyo, which constitute the core of the Tokyo metropolitan area, each have an administrative status analogous to that of cities. Tokyo also has several other incorporated cities, towns and villages within its jurisdiction.\nHistory.\nCities were introduced under the \"city code\" (\"shisei\", \u5e02\u5236) of 1888 during the \"Great Meiji mergers\" (\"Meiji no daigappei\", \u660e\u6cbb\u306e\u5927\u5408\u4f75) of 1889. The \"-shi\" replaced the previous urban districts/\"wards/cities\" \"(-ku)\" that had existed as primary subdivisions of prefectures besides rural districts \"(-gun)\" since 1878. Initially, there were 39 cities in 1889: only one in most prefectures, two in a few (Yamagata, Toyama, Osaka, Hy\u014dgo, Fukuoka), and none in some \u2013 Miyazaki became the last prefecture to contain its first city in 1924. In Okinawa-ken and Hokkai-d\u014d which were not yet fully equal prefectures in the Empire, major urban settlements remained organized as urban districts until the 1920s: Naha-ku and Shuri-ku, the two urban districts of Okinawa were only turned into Naha-shi and Shuri-shi in May 1921, and six -ku of Hokkaid\u014d were converted into district-independent cities in August 1922.\nBy 1945, the number of cities countrywide had increased to 205. After WWII, their number almost doubled during the \"great Sh\u014dwa mergers\" of the 1950s and continued to grow so that it surpassed the number of towns in the early 21st century (see the List of mergers and dissolutions of municipalities in Japan). As of October 1 2018, there are 792 cities of Japan."}

It appears in documented records at least as far back as the year 990. In 1232, Archambaud VIII, Sire de Bourbon granted a franchise to the village's inhabitants.\nThe town achieved greater prominence in 1327, when Charles IV elevated Louis I de Clermont to Duke of Bourbon. Either Louis or the later Peter II, Duke of Bourbon and of Auvergne moved the capital of the province from Bourbon-l'Archambault to Moulins.\nIn February 1566 it became eponymous to the Edict of Moulins, an important royal ordinance dealing with many aspects of the administration of justice and feudal and ecclesiastical privilege, including limitations on the appanages held by French princes, abrogation of the levy of rights of tallage claimed by seigneurs over their dependants, and provisions for a system of concessions on rivers.\nThis was the birthplace of the great 19th-century operatic baritone and art collector Jean-Baptiste Faure.

It depicts the death of a child assailed by a supernatural being, the Erlking, a king of the fairies. It was originally written by Goethe as part of a 1782 \"Singspiel\", .\n\"Erlk\u00f6nig\" has been called Goethe's \"most famous ballad\". The poem has been set to music by several composers, most notably by Franz Schubert.\nSummary.\nAn anxious young boy is being carried at night by his father on horseback. To where is not spelled out; German \"\" has a rather broad meaning of \"yard\", \"courtyard\", \"farm\", or (royal) \"court\". The opening line tells that the time is late and that it is windy.\nAs the poem unfolds, the son claims to see and hear the \"Erlk\u00f6nig\" (Erl-King). His father claims to not see or hear the creature, and he attempts to comfort his son, asserting natural explanations for what the child sees \u2013 a wisp of fog, rustling leaves, shimmering willows.\nThe Erl-King attempts to lure the child into joining him, promising amusement, rich clothes, and the attentions of his daughters. Finally, the Erl-King declares that he will take the child by force. The boy shrieks that he has been attacked, spurring the father to ride faster to the . Upon reaching the destination, the child is already dead.\nThe legend.\nThe story of the Erlk\u00f6nig derives from the traditional Danish ballad \"Elveskud\": Goethe's poem was inspired by Johann Gottfried Herder's translation of a variant of the ballad (\"Danmarks gamle Folkeviser 47B\", from Peter Syv's 1695 edition) into German as (\"The Erl-King's Daughter\") in his collection of folk songs, (published 1778). Goethe's poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the Erlking. Niels Gade's cantata , Op. 30 (1854, text by ) was published in translation as .\n In the original Scandinavian version of the tale, the antagonist was the Erlk\u00f6nig's daughter rather than the Erlk\u00f6nig himself.\nSettings to music.\nThe poem has often been set to music, with Franz Schubert's rendition, his Opus\u00a01 (D.\u00a0328), being the best known. Probably the next-best known is that of Carl Loewe (1818). Other notable settings are by members of Goethe's circle, including actress Corona Schr\u00f6ter (1782), Andreas Romberg (1793), Johann Friedrich Reichardt (1794), and Carl Friedrich Zelter (1797). Ludwig van Beethoven attempted to set it to music, but abandoned the effort; his sketch, however, was full enough to be published in a completion by Reinhold Becker (1897). A few other 19th-century versions are those by V\u00e1clav Tom\u00e1\u0161ek (1815) and Louis Spohr (1856, with obbligato violin; Op. 154 No. 4) and Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst (Polyphonic Studies for Solo Violin), though his was essentially a transcription of Schubert's version for solo violin. Twenty-first-century examples are pianist Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin's \"Etude No. 8 (after Goethe)\" for solo piano, based on \"Erlk\u00f6nig\".\nFranz Schubert composition.\nFranz Schubert composed his \"Lied\" \"Erlk\u00f6nig\" for solo voice and piano at the age of 17 or 18 in 1815, setting text from Goethe's poem. The work was first performed in concert on 1 December 1820 at a private gathering in Vienna. The public premiere on 7 March 1821 at the Theater am K\u00e4rntnertor was a great success, and he quickly rose to fame among the composers in Vienna. It is one of Schubert's most famous works, with enduring popularity and acclaim since its premiere in 1821.\nCarl Loewe composition.\nCarl Loewe's setting was published as Op.\u00a01, No.\u00a03 and composed in 1817\u201318, in the lifetime of the poem's author and also of Schubert, whose version Loewe did not then know. Collected with it were Op.\u00a01, No.\u00a01, \"Edward\" (1818; a translation of the Scottish ballad), and No.\u00a02, \"\" (1823; \"The Innkeeper's Daughter\"), a poem of Ludwig Uhland. Inspired by a German translation of Scottish border ballads, Loewe set several poems with an elvish theme; but although all three of Op.\u00a01 are concerned with untimely death, in this set only the \"Erlk\u00f6nig\" has the supernatural element.\nLoewe's accompaniment is in semiquaver groups of six in time and marked (fast). The vocal line evokes the galloping effect by repeated figures of crotchet and quaver, or sometimes three quavers, overlying the binary tremolo of the semiquavers in the piano. In addition to an unusual sense of motion, this creates a flexible template for the stresses in the words to fall correctly within the rhythmic structure.\nLoewe's version is less melodic than Schubert's, with an insistent, repetitive harmonic structure between the opening minor key and answering phrases in the major key of the dominant, which have a stark quality owing to their unusual relationship to the home key. The narrator's phrases are echoed by the voices of father and son, the father taking up the deeper, rising phrase, and the son a lightly undulating, answering theme around the dominant fifth. These two themes also evoke the rising and moaning of the wind.\nThe Erl-King, who is always heard pianissimo, does not sing melodies, but instead delivers insubstantial rising arpeggios that outline a single major chord (that of the home key) which sounds simultaneously on the piano in \"una corda\" tremolo. Only with his final threatening word, \"Gewalt\", does he depart from this chord. Loewe's implication is that the Erlking has no substance but merely exists in the child's feverish imagination. As the piece progresses, the first in the groups of three quavers is dotted to create a breathless pace, which then forms a bass figure in the piano driving through to the final crisis. The last words, , leap from the lower dominant to the sharpened third of the home key; this time not to the major but to a diminished chord, which settles chromatically through the home key in the major and then to the minor."}

One of the most famous child actors of all time, he became very popular in 1930s Hollywood films. His most famous starring roles are in \"Captains Courageous\" (1937) and \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" (1936).\nHe was born in London, and for the title role of MGM's \"David Copperfield\" (1935), he immigrated to the United States at the age of 10 in 1934, living there the rest of his life. He became an American citizen in 1943 following World War II military service.\nDespite his great success and acclaim following \"David Copperfield\", his childhood film stardom was marred by nearly constant legal battles and payouts, which eventually took a huge toll on both his finances and his career. In adulthood, after World War II service, his film career dwindled rapidly, and he switched from performing to directing and producing in the medium of television.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBartholomew was born Frederick Cecil Bartholomew in March 1924 in Harlesden in the borough of Willesden, Middlesex, London. His parents were Cecil Llewellyn Bartholomew, a wounded World War I veteran who became a minor civil servant after the war, and Lilian May Clarke Bartholomew. By the age of three, Freddie was living in Warminster, a town in Wiltshire in southwest England, in his paternal grandparents' home. He lived under the care of his aunt \"Cissie\", Millicent Mary Bartholomew, who raised him and became his surrogate mother. Bartholomew was educated at Lord Weymouth's Grammar School in Warminster, and by his Aunt Cissie.\nChild star.\nFrom England to Hollywood.\nIn Warminster, Bartholomew was a precocious actor and was reciting and performing from age three. By age five he was a popular Warminster celebrity, the \"boy wonder elocutionist\", reciting poems, prose, and selections from various plays, including Shakespeare. He sang and danced as well. His first film role came by the age of six, in 1930.\nHe also pursued acting studies at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London, and appeared in a total of four minor British films. American filmmakers George Cukor and David O. Selznick saw him on a 1934 scouting trip to London and chose him for the young title role in their MGM film \"David Copperfield\" (1935). Bartholomew and his aunt immigrated to the United States in August 1934, and MGM gave him a seven-year contract.\n\"David Copperfield\", which also featured Basil Rathbone, Maureen O'Sullivan, W. C. Fields, and Lionel Barrymore, was a success, and made Bartholomew an overnight star. He was subsequently cast in a succession of film productions with some of the most popular stars of the day. Among his successes of the 1930s were \"Anna Karenina\" (1935) with Greta Garbo and Fredric March; \"Professional Soldier\" (1935) with Victor McLaglen and Gloria Stuart; \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" (1936) with Dolores Costello and C. Aubrey Smith; \"Lloyd's of London\" (1937) with Madeleine Carroll and Tyrone Power; \"The Devil is a Sissy\" (1936) with Mickey Rooney and Jackie Cooper; and \"Captains Courageous\" (1937) with Spencer Tracy.\n\"Captains Courageous\" was the movie he most enjoyed working on. The film took an entire year to make, and much of it was shot off the coasts of Florida and Catalina Island, California. He later recalled, \"For a kid, it was like one long outing. Spencer Tracy, Lionel Barrymore, Mickey Rooney, Melvyn Douglas and I \u2013 we all grew very close toward one another in those 12 months. When the shooting was finished, we cried like a bunch of babies as we said our goodbyes.\"\nHis acting skills, open and personable presence, emotional range, refined English diction, and angelic looks made him a box-office favorite. He quickly became the second-highest-paid child movie star after Shirley Temple. Ring Lardner Jr. had high praise for him, saying of his performance as the star of \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\", \"He is on the screen almost constantly, and his performance is a valid characterization, which is almost unique in a child actor, and, indeed, in three fourths of adult motion-picture stars.\" Of his role as the protagonist of \"Captains Courageous\", Frank Nugent of the \"New York Times\" wrote, \"Young Master Bartholomew ... plays Harvey faultlessly.\"\nBy April 1936, following the very popular \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\", Bartholomew's success and level of fame caused his long-estranged birth parents to attempt to gain custody of him and his fortune. A legal battle of nearly seven years ensued, resulting in nearly all the wealth that Bartholomew amassed being spent on attorneys' and court fees, and payouts to his birth parents and two sisters.\nMGM contract troubles.\nThe extreme financial drain of his birth parents' ongoing custody battles prompted Bartholomew's aunt to demand a raise in his salary from MGM in July 1937, leveraged by the huge success of \"Captains Courageous\". She threatened to break his MGM contract in order to find a better-paying studio. The contract battle kept him out of work for a year, causing among other things the postponement and eventual loss of his planned lead in a film of Rudyard Kipling's \"Kim\", and the loss of his planned lead in \"Thoroughbreds Don't Cry\" with Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney.\nHe eventually resumed acting through 1942, in mostly lesser-quality films and roles, only three out of 11 of which were with MGM, and after 1938 he was less popular than in his heyday. This fall in popularity stemmed not only from the quality of the roles and his conflicts with MGM, but also from the fact that by late 1938 he was a tall, nearly 6-foot teenager, and the fact that the world was focusing on the growing problems of World War II and therefore the literary classics and costume dramas Bartholomew excelled at were less in fashion.\nIn 1938, Twentieth Century Fox hired him for the lead in their film of Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Kidnapped\". MGM then re-teamed him for the fourth and fifth times with Mickey Rooney in \"Lord Jeff\" (1938) and \"A Yank at Eton\" (1942), and he co-starred with Judy Garland in the lightweight MGM musical \"Listen, Darling\" in 1938.\nIn 1939 Universal re-teamed him for the third and fourth times with Jackie Cooper in \"The Spirit of Culver\" and \"Two Bright Boys\". For RKO distribution, he performed in \"Swiss Family Robinson\" and \"Tom Brown's School Days\" in 1940. And as World War II deepened, Columbia had him star in three military-related films: \"Naval Academy\" (1941), \"Cadets on Parade\" (1942), and \"Junior Army\" (1942).\nWorld War II and beyond.\nEnlistment and aftermath.\nWorld War II military service interrupted Bartholomew's career even further. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces on January 13, 1943, at the age of 18, and worked in aircraft maintenance. During training he fell and injured his back, was hospitalized for seven months, and was discharged on January 12, 1944.\nHe had one film role in 1944, in the low-budget comedy \"The Town Went Wild\". The film reunited him with Jimmy Lydon, with whom he had starred in \"Tom Brown's School Days\", \"Naval Academy\", and \"Cadets on Parade\". This ended up being Bartholomew's penultimate film performance, and his last for seven years. His efforts to revive his film career were unsuccessful; and efforts performing in regional theaters and vaudeville did not spark a comeback either.\nAfter distressing experiences including a devastating auto accident and performing unsuccessfully in a play in Los Angeles, in 1946 Bartholomew married publicist Maely Daniele. Daniele, six years his senior, was a twice-divorced woman, and his marriage to her caused a serious and permanent rift with his aunt, who moved back to England. The marriage was not a happy one.\nIn 1946 he was in a radio play in an episode of \"Inner Sanctum Mystery\". In 1947, he appeared as himself in a five-minute cameo in the otherwise all-black musical film \"Sepia Cinderella\", relating his post-war efforts to have a successful vaudeville routine and telling a few gags onscreen. He spent most of 1948 touring small American theaters, and in November 1948 left without his wife for an Australian tour as a night-club singing, patter, and piano act.\nSwitch to television and off-camera work.\nUpon his return to the United States in 1949, and in rather desperate circumstances, he switched to the new and burgeoning medium of television. He shifted from performer to television host and director to television producer and executive. Preferring to be known as Fred C. Bartholomew, he became the television director of independent television station WPIX in New York City from 1949 through 1954. His final acting role was as a priest in the 1951 film \"St. Benny the Dip\".\nHe divorced his first wife in 1953, and in December of that year he married television chef and author Aileen Paul, whom he had met at WPIX. With her he had a daughter, Kathleen Millicent Bartholomew, born in March 1956, and a son, Frederick R. Bartholomew, born in 1958. The family, including stepdaughter Celia Ann Paul, lived in Leonia, New Jersey.\nThis was an era in which advertising firms created and produced radio and television shows. In 1954, Bartholomew began working for Benton &amp; Bowles, a New York advertising agency, as a television producer and director. At Benton &amp; Bowles, he produced shows such as \"The Andy Griffith Show\", and produced or directed several television soap operas including \"As the World Turns\", \"The Edge of Night\" and \"Search for Tomorrow\". In 1964 he was made a vice president of radio and television at the company.\nBartholomew and his second wife divorced by early 1977. He eventually remarried in February 1976, and remained married to his third wife, Elizabeth Grabill, for the rest of his life.\nSuffering from emphysema, he retired from television by the late 1980s. He eventually moved with his family to Bradenton, Florida. In 1991 he was filmed in several interview segments for the documentary film \"MGM: When the Lion Roars\" (1992). He died of heart failure in Sarasota, Florida in January 1992, at the age of 67.\nMentions in popular culture.\nThe seven-minute Warner Bros. cartoon \"The Major Lied 'Til Dawn\" (1938) includes a caricature of Bartholomew as his Little Lord Fauntleroy role.\nHe was also caricatured, along with many other Hollywood celebrities, in the eight-minute 1938 Disney cartoon \"Mother Goose Goes Hollywood\" \u2013 in this case as his character from the film \"Captains Courageous\". As in the film, Freddie falls into the sea and is saved by Spencer Tracy's character.\nA non-alcoholic cocktail \u2013 a parallel of the Shirley Temple \u2013 which combines ginger ale with lime juice, known as a \"Freddie Bartholomew cocktail\", is named for him.\nAlthough his name is not mentioned, he is referred to in J. D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\", as a figure whom Holden Caulfield looks like \u2013 specifically, Bartholomew's most iconic role as Harvey Cheyne in \"Captains Courageous\" (1937), referred to by the character Sunny as the kid in the movie \"who falls off [a] boat\"."}

The village is surrounded by land known as Everleigh Drop Zone, owned by the Ministry of Defence that is used for military training as part of the Salisbury Plain Training Area.\nHistory.\nThe partly-forested area was known for recreational hunting. By the 13th century there was a deer park and a rabbit warren, and later activities included hare coursing, falconry and racehorse training. East Everleigh developed at a crossroads where the old Marlborough-Salisbury road (now only a track in the south of the parish) met the Devizes-Andover road (now the A342). In the 18th and 19th centuries, several inns provided refreshment and lodging.\nThe Everleigh estate was bought by Sir John Astley in 1765, and inherited in 1771 by his cousin Francis Dugdale Astley; it continued as the seat of the Astley baronets until the middle of the next century. Sir Francis made changes to the village layout around 1811, removing buildings which stood close to the manor house and diverting the road away from it. Those demolished included the old church (rebuilt by Sir Francis further west) and the \"Rose and Crown\" inn.\nManor house.\nJames VI and I and Anne of Denmark came from Wilton House to Everleigh on 31 August 1603 to visit Mr Sadler, a son of Queen Elizabeth's Ambassador to Scotland, Sir Ralph Sadler.\nThe present Everleigh Manor was built in the 18th century, possibly on the site of the earlier house, and extended with east and west wings later in the century. In 1882 the central block was virtually reconstructed following a fire. It is a two-storey country house in brick and stone, originally five bays, extended to nine.\nThe Manor House was once a holding area for the prisoners during the Bloody Assizes with trials held by Judge Jeffreys in 1685. It was connected to a public house nearby, known as \"The Crown\", by a tunnel where prisoners would be led to and from the court house and manor. The tunnel is now blocked up on either end of both the manor and public house, but the tunnel still exists to this day.\nThe manor house was bought by the National Deposit Friendly Society in 1921, for use as a convalescent home. The house was requisitioned in 1939 and, with new buildings added in its grounds, became a military hospital used by the US Army; there was also a vaccine laboratory. In 1951 the west wing was named the David Bruce Laboratory, and by this time the site was used by the Royal Army Medical Corps; the house and grounds were bought by the War Office in 1954. The Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 map of 1958 shows many small buildings in the grounds to the northwest of the manor house.\nThe Army left the site c.\u00a01990 and the house returned to use as a private residence. As of 2016, the west wing is operated as a hotel.\nParish church.\nEverleigh had a parish church by 1228, when it was granted to the Benedictine Wherwell Abbey in Hampshire. However, the mediaeval parish church was demolished in 1814 when the present Church of England parish church of Saint Peter was consecrated on a site about northwest of it. The present church was designed by the architect John Morlidge in a Georgian Gothic Revival style. It includes the original Norman font from the old church.\nThe Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre holds the parish registers for 1598 to 1971 (baptisms), 1598-1974 (marriages), and 1598-1984 (burials). The population in 1831 was 352, but by 1951 it had fallen to 264.\nRev. Prof. John Wallis (1675-1738), who was rector of Everleigh from 1716, was at the same time Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford. In the 1760s the living was held by John Butler, who was later Bishop of Oxford and Bishop of Hereford.\nLocal government.\nEverleigh is a civil parish with an elected parish council. The village is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.\nRecreation.\nThe Orange Way long-distance footpath passes through Everleigh village in a southwest\u2013northeast direction."}

Voiced by Jen Taylor, she appears in ' and its sequels, \"Halo 2\", \"Halo 3\", \"Halo 4\", \" and Halo Infinite\". She also briefly appears in the prequel ', as well as in several of the franchise's novels, comics, and merchandise. During gameplay, Cortana provides backstory and tactical information to the player, who often assumes the role of Master Chief Petty Officer John-117. In the story, she is instrumental in preventing the activation of the Halo installations, which would have destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy.\nCortana's original design was based on the Egyptian queen Nefertiti; the character's holographic representation always takes the form of a woman. Game developer Bungie first introduced Cortana\u2014and \"Halo\"\u2014through the Cortana Letters, emails sent during \"Combat Evolved\"s production in 1999.\nThe relationship between Cortana and Master Chief has been highlighted by reviewers as one of the most important parts of the \"Halo\" games' story. Cortana has been recognized for her believability and character depth, as well as her sex appeal. The character was the inspiration for Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant of the same name.\nDescription.\nCortana is an artificial intelligence found in the \"Halo\" franchise. In the video games, Cortana often serves as an advisor and assistant to the player character, hacking alien computer systems and decoding transmissions. She speaks most of the first game's dialogue, and serves as a talkative foil for the quieter Master Chief, as well as a way of relaying information and objectives to the player.\nAccording to her backstory, Cortana was derived from the cloned brain of Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey, the creator of the SPARTAN-II supersoldier project; Halsey's synapses became the basis for Cortana's processors. Cortana and other AIs are subject to a seven-year lifespan, after which they begin to dissemble and think themselves to death in a process known as rampancy.\nAs an artificial construct, Cortana has no physical form or being. Cortana speaks with a smooth female voice, and projects a holographic image of herself as a woman. Cortana is said to resemble Halsey, with a similar attitude \"unchecked by military and social protocol\". In \"\", Cortana is described as slender, with close-cropped hair and a skin hue that varies from navy blue to lavender, depending on her mood. Numbers and symbols flash across her form when she is thinking. Halsey sees Cortana as a teenage version of herself: smarter than her parents, always \"talking, learning, and eager to share her knowledge\". Cortana is described as having a sardonic sense of humor and often cracks jokes or wryly comments, even during combat.\nAppearances.\nIn video games.\nCortana's first game appearance is in 2001's \"\". Humanity is locked in a losing war with the alien Covenant. Cortana plots a course for the human ship \"Pillar of Autumn\" to escape the Covenant. This heading leads to the discovery of a massive ringworld, Halo, built by a mysterious race known as the Forerunners. Cortana defends the ship from the Covenant until she is given to the supersoldier Master Chief to prevent her from falling into enemy hands. Cortana helps direct human survivors scattered across the ring and assists the Master Chief in his missions. Inserted into Halo's Control Room, Cortana realizes that the ring serves as a prison for the parasitic Flood; activating Halo would mean destroying all sentient life in the galaxy to prevent the Flood's spread. Cortana assists Master Chief in destroying the ring and escaping.\nIn \"Halo 2\", Cortana assists in the defense of Earth in the wake of a Covenant attack. Cortana, Chief and human forces travel to another Halo ring, Delta Halo, where Master Chief and Cortana encounter the Flood intelligence Gravemind. The Gravemind sends Chief and Cortana to the Covenant city-ship of \"High Charity\" to stop the Covenant from activating Halo; Cortana ultimately stays behind on \"High Charity\" to destroy the city and Halo should Master Chief fail in his mission. \"High Charity\" and Cortana are captured by the Flood. \nIn \"Halo 3\", Cortana appears to the player in broken transmissions. On the Forerunner installation known as the Ark, the Master Chief travels through the ruins of \"High Charity\" to rescue Cortana. Chief and Cortana are successful at stopping the Flood, but become stranded in deep space aboard the human ship \"Forward Unto Dawn\". Cortana activates a distress beacon, while Master Chief goes into cryonic sleep to await rescue.\nAt the beginning of \"Halo 4\" Cortana wakes the Chief as \"Forward Unto Dawn\" drifts towards a Forerunner installation called Requiem. Cortana begins displaying aberrant glitches and behavior, and reveals that she is suffering from rampancy as she approaches the end of her seven-year lifespan. She assists in the battle against the Didact, a rogue Forerunner who hates humans. At the end, Cortana sacrifices herself to save the Chief and stop the Didact's plan. Cortana's survival is revealed in \"Halo 5\", when she calls Master Chief to the Forerunner world Genesis. Cortana explains she survived the destruction of the Didact's ship and her own rampancy by entering the Domain, an ancient repository of knowledge. Granted an infinite life span by the Domain, Cortana believes that she and other AI (the \"Created\") should enforce peace through the galaxy. Cortana begins using ancient Forerunner constructs known as Guardians to enforce the Created's will throughout the galaxy.\nIn \"Halo Infinite\", Master Chief travels to the Zeta Halo and recovers the Weapon, a copy of Cortana designed to trap her for deletion. Traveling across a damaged Halo's surface and fighting the Banished, the pair recover data fragments left behind by Cortana that fill in what occurred six months earlier; Cortana threatened the Banished leader Atriox, and destroyed his homeworld when he did not submit. In retaliation, a vengeful Atriox used the Weapon to capture Cortana, informing her that the Banished had already defeated the UNSC and Chief, and orders Cortana to surrender the ring to the Banished. Being locked down by her copy and witnessing Chief\u2019s death, Cortana finally realizes her mistakes. She then destroys herself by destroying the ring, preventing the Banished from activating it, unlocking its secrets and deactivating all Guardians. In a final message, Cortana apologizes to Chief for her actions and encourages him to work with the Weapon against the Banished.\nOther appearances.\nCortana's first appearance in the \"Halo\" franchise is in the novel ', a prequel to the first \"Halo\" game. Dr. Halsey allows Cortana to choose which SPARTAN-II soldier to accompany on an upcoming mission; Cortana picks the Master Chief, whom she believes is her best match. Cortana helps the Master Chief to survive the near-lethal exercises designed to test the Chief's armor. Afterward, she plants incriminating evidence in the files of Colonel Ackerson, the operative who nearly killed both of them, as revenge. Cortana makes a small appearance in 2010's ', set shortly before the events of \"Combat Evolved\". A fragment of Cortana carrying information gleaned from a Forerunner artifact combines with Cortana's main self on \"Pillar of Autumn\" before the ship escapes the planet, leading to the events of \"Combat Evolved\".\nCortana also appears in the novelization of \"Combat Evolved\", ', and the following novels ' and ', as well as the animated series \"Halo Legends\" and live-action television series '. She is also a main character in \"Human Weakness\", a short story written by Karen Traviss for the \"Halo Evolutions\" anthology that details Cortana's time in the clutches of the Gravemind.\nShe also appears in the \"Halo\" television series, created by Dr. Halsey as a means of keeping Master Chief and other Spartans in line. By cloning herself and then copying her clone's brain patterns (which also kills her), Halsey is able to bring Cortana to life and then implant her directly into Master Chief's neural pathways.\nCharacter design.\nCortana was developed to provide \"Combat Evolved\" with a way of guiding players while keeping missions open-ended, and avoiding players from feeling they were being herded through the game. Said story writer Joseph Staten, \"we needed a character who could consistently guide the player through the game, and an onboard AI was something that could always credibly accompany [them].\" Cortana's role grew from pure gameplay considerations to serving as a way of characterizing and humanizing the Master Chief, and in subsequent games the Chief-Cortana relationship became a focus of characterization.\nThe character was designed and modeled by Bungie artist Chris Hughes, with the model's face based on a sculpture of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti. Cortana's name is a variant of Curtana, the sword used by the legendary Ogier the Dane, just as the titular AI character of Bungie's previous game \"\" is named after the legendary sword Durendal. Curtana's inscription reveals that the sword has the same \"temper as Joyeuse and Durendal\". After assuming development duties from Bungie, 343 Industries decided to explain Cortana's established appearance as a reflection of her personality. \"So one of the reasons she [appears as she does] is to attract and demand attention,\" Franchise development coordinator Frank O'Connor explained. \"And she does it to put people off so that they're on their guard when talking to her and she has the upper hand in those conversations.\"\nCortana and the Master Chief's relationship was a core part of \"Halo 4\", part of a desire to feature a more human story. Creative director Josh Holmes noted that Cortana was in ways more human than Master Chief, and the idea that Chief would grapple with his humanity at the same time he was losing Cortana spoke to him. Holmes' mother was diagnosed with dementia during development, and his real-life struggles informed the characterization of Cortana's descent into rampancy and the Chief-Cortana relationship. Holmes and the team drew inspiration from the relationship in the game \"Ico\", where the main characters share a strong bond, as well as the many layers to the two characters' relationship; \"In some ways they\u2019re friends, in some ways she\u2019s almost like a mother, in others they\u2019re skirting that line of lovers, and so all these different elements come into the relationship, making it complex and interesting to explore.\" Cortana's new appearance for \"Halo 4\" was one of the game's most dramatic changes. Early in production, concept artists created a variety of \"crazy ideas\" and explorations for how Cortana might look. Promising 2D designs were turned into simple 3D maquettes to prototype them in the game engine. Character artist Matt Aldridge recalled that Cortana was one of the hardest characters to envision in the game because of how beloved the character is by players; one of Aldridge's goals was to create a character where scrolling lines of code would flow uninterrupted from her feet to her head. Art director Kenneth Scott was responsible for Cortana's final design. The character's motion capture was performed by Mackenzie Mason.\nFor \"Halo 5\", Cortana's appearance changes significantly. Describing her previous appearance as soft and \"deceptively vulnerable\", 343 Industries took the story opportunity provided to change her look to reflect her new role as self-declared ruler of the galaxy. \"In the first draft of the ending she was going to wear a flowing gown, have long hair, etc. She'd be very regal, very \u201cpowerful high queen.\" Very obviously different than she was,\" writer Brian Reed recalled. Her final design incorporated elements of the Spartans and Forerunners on top of her previous look, including a Forerunner glyph. \"Having her wear [the Mantle] was a nice way of having her own it too, from a symbolic standpoint,\" Reed said. The character was modeled and animated using motion capture and talent at 343 Industries and Axis Animation. 343 Industries intended the character's normal role in gameplay to be filled by Blue Team.\nCortana's design, particularly her human-like appearance, was met with controversy after the TV series' trailer was released. Kiki Wolfkill explained that the decision was influenced by technology, as the team prefers to use the most up-to-date tools to make thoughtful design decisions, as they have done throughout the series' decades-long history. She further said \"A lot of the design changes as we progress[ed] through the game generations was because we had access to better graphics, technology, more pixels, and more effects. And so it's always been about adapting Cortana to the environment.\"\nVoice acting.\nVoice actress Jen Taylor voices Cortana in the majority of the character's appearances. Despite her role in voicing other video game characters, including Princess Peach, she is not a gamer. Taylor was a college acquaintance of Joseph Staten, and he recommended her as a possible voice for Cortana to audio director Martin O'Donnell. When choosing a voice actor for the character, Bungie originally wanted Cortana to have a British accent. O'Donnell recalled that Taylor's British accent was good, but felt it was too similar to her work for \"\". The accent was dropped, but British colloquialisms remained in the character's dialogue. Taylor recalled that a key directive from Bungie about the character was that she not come off as nagging, despite her role as the player's guide and aid. \"They wanted her to be like the girl next door, your best friend that you want to hang out with,\" she said. She felt that portraying Cortana was occasionally challenging because the character lacks a physical form.\nFor years after the first game was released Taylor remained distanced from the character. She attended only one fan convention in six years after the release of \"Halo: Combat Evolved\", and never saw many of the finished cutscenes with the character until a \"Halo 3\" launch party. Starting with \"Halo 3\", Taylor felt the role involved more drama and less jargon, and over time, her relationship with the character changed. \"At first I was just excited to have a job and then I became more and more familiar, comfortable with and interested in her as she was developed,\" she recalled. \"And I've sort of fallen for Cortana as far as characters go. She's remarkable.\" For \"Halo 4\", Taylor performed her lines in the same room as Steve Downes, the voice of Master Chief, for the first time in the series. She credited the change for making the dialogue feel more authentic and real. She reprises her role as Cortana for the \"Halo\" television series.\nPromotion.\nBungie introduced the \"Halo\" series publicly in 1999 by sending the Cortana Letters, a series of cryptic email messages, to the maintainer of marathon.bungie.org, a fan site for one of Bungie's other game series. The strategic use of cryptic messages in a publicity campaign was repeated in \"I Love Bees\", a promotion for \"Halo 2\". Although Bungie does not consider most of the letters to be canon, Cortana speaks many of the same lines in \"Halo 3\". According to C. J. Cowan, Bungie's director of cinematics, the studio used the character here to give story clues without actually revealing the story.\nCortana is featured in a variety of \"Halo\" merchandise. The character's first action figure was a seven-inch (178\u00a0mm) miniature released as part of the \"\" series of action figures. McLees noted that the first action figure was supposed to convey an older appearance than was depicted in the games. This was accomplished by making the figure more buxom; despite McLees' request to revert the change, the sculptor was unwilling and time constraints left the design intact. The character is also featured in the first series of \"Halo 3\" action figures, distributed by McFarlane Toys, Funko vinyl figurines, and in a limited-edition silver-plated statue by Weta Workshop. \"IGN\" noted that Cortana toys are lacking among \"Halo\"s merchandising.\nWindows digital assistant.\nMicrosoft developed its virtual assistant for the Windows Phone operating system under the codename \"Cortana\" in reference to the \"Halo\" character. Though other final gender-neutral names for the final product were considered, positive developer and fan response to the leaked codename led to it becoming permanent. Deborah Harrison, one of Cortana's 'personality designers', met with 343 Industries and added more confidence to the personality. \"As a result of the meetings we ended up coming back and baking this into the DNA of the digital assistant speech pattern, her approach to jokes and her approach to chit chat, and we decided to dial up her sense of self possession,\" Harrison recalled. Jen Taylor provides the voice for the virtual assistant. Microsoft released a beta for Cortana in April 2014 with the developer release of Windows Phone 8.1. Microsoft also released Cortana virtual assistant on the Xbox One, Windows 10, iOS, and Android platforms.\nReception.\nCortana is one of \"Halo\"s most beloved characters, and has appeared in numerous lists of video game's best sidekicks. \"Tom's Hardware\" named the character one of the 50 greatest female characters for the character's determination and fearlessness, which meshed perfectly with the game's protagonist, while \"Glixel\" staff described Cortana as one of the most iconic video game character of the 21st century. \"Den of Geek\"s Megan Crouse called Cortana one of the \"Halo\" series' most important characters, and her relationship with her mother figure Halsey a relationship that was under-appreciated in much of the franchise. Professor Monica Evans on a book \"Halo and Philosophy: Intellect Evolved\" called Cortana the most human character in the original game and one of the most developed.\nCortana has also been recognized for her sex appeal; the character has been included on lists of attractive video game characters from publications such as \"Team Xbox\", \"GameDaily\", \"Games.net\", \"Thanh Ni\u00ean\", and \"Complex\". Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian argues that Cortana had gotten \"more and more sexualized in every new installment\"; \"1UP.com\" noted that as Cortana's sanity waned in the video games, her clothing appeared to decrease as well. \"Time\"s Matt Peckham described Cortana's character as a controversial figure, with a tension between being well-rounded character and being trapped as \"[an] adolescent male's fantasy notion of a Campbellian hero figure,\" and that this tension had increased commensurately with the game series' graphical fidelity. Media critic Maddy Myers suggested that O'Connor's explanation for Cortana's look implies that the \"Halo\" universe's futuristic setting still grapples with systemic sexism.\nMike Rougeau of \"Complex\" noted that \"Halo 3\" balanced a large conflict with a more personal one\u2014that while the galaxy was imperiled by aliens, \"more important to fans was the rescue of Cortana.\" While Cortana's role was greatly expanded in the game, \"Stuff.co.nz\" noted that the character \"has inexplicably had a sexy makeover\". \nDespite mixed opinions of \"Halo 4\"s campaign as a whole, Cortana and her story was often considered a strong point of the game. \"IGN\" called \"Halo 4\" \"really Cortana's story\", as saving the galaxy is of lesser importance to the Master Chief than saving Cortana, and Cortana's humanity is ultimately the game's focus. \"The Daily Telegraph\"s Tom Hoggins agreed, calling Cortana \"the flickering blue heart of the game's plot\", and Hoggins and reviewers for \"The Globe and Mail\" and \"Eurogamer\" singled out the character's writing and performance as high points of the game's campaign. Justin Clouse wrote that the interactions between Chief and Cortana as the latter loses her hold on sanity were \"perhaps the best it's ever been\". \"Complex\"s review praised the use of motion capture for Cortana, as they were given \"new life\" and new depth from the technology and performance.\nDavid Their wrote that the choice for Cortana to return in \"Halo 5\" and turn her into an antagonist provided the game \"with a well earned sense of drive\" and that her appearance in \"Halo 5\" gave players another side of the character to see. \"There's something unknowable about Cortana in her new role as AI God, but we've spent enough time with her throughout the series that we stick with her through the reinvention.\" Similarly, Patrick Dane of \"Bleeding Cool\" defended the game's divisive campaign and Cortana's turn to antagonist as an \"inspired choice\", driving a wedge between the most important character relationship in the games. Conversely, Matt Peckham felt that the plot twist of Cortana's actions \"feels strangely underwhelming\", while \"Ars Technica\" and \"Kotaku\" considered Cortana's return, and her plans to use alien technology to remake the galaxy, unbelievable and unearned. Responding to criticism that 343 had turned Cortana \"evil\", franchise director Frank O'Connor said, \"my question back to them is, 'What makes you say they\u2019re evil?' Certainly a lot of our younger players are going to struggle with that subtlety, that nuance, because they\u2019re expecting Darth Vader.\" Stephen Wilds of \"Polygon\" said that that \"there aren\u2019t notable antagonists, but that they tend to disappear after a couple games\", and wondered if Cortana could have been a \"full-fledged villain at the end of \"Halo 5\"\" and would be praised by fans."}

Makadmeh, one of Hamas' founders and a leader of the group's military wing, was accused of engineering several attacks that killed 28 Israelis.\nBiography.\nAl-Makadmeh, age 52, was the father of seven children. He was a devoted preacher and political activist opposed to the Israeli occupation of Palestine. He was born in 1952, four years after his family was expelled from the village of Yibna, south-west of Jerusalem, when Israel was created. Al-Makadmeh's family fled to the refugee camps at Bureij and later moved to Jabalia.\nAfter graduating from secondary school in Jabalia, al-Makadmeh studied dentistry in Egypt where he adopted the Islamist ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood. When he returned to Gaza, al-Makadmeh began organizing th Palestinian Islamist movement and a few years later, he and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin founded Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic resistance movement.\nIn 1984, the Israelis arrested, charged and convicted al-Makadmeh with possessing and supplying arms to Palestinian militants. During his eight years in Israeli prisons he allegedly was subjected to physical and psychological torture.\nIn 1992, he was released from prison and began working as dentist at the Shifa Hospital in Gaza while continuing his Hamas activities. His harsh criticisms of Palestinian Authority corruption and the Oslo Accords, as well as vocal support for Hamas attacks on Israel, led the Palestinian Authority to arrest him several times. He was detained for three years without charge or trial and allegedly was tortured in custody, this time by Palestinian authorities.\nKilling.\nAl-Makadmeh and three of his aides were killed when three Israeli Apache helicopter gunships fired up to five missiles at the car he was in as it drove down a street in downtown Gaza City. Makadmeh's killing came after Hamas claimed responsibility for an attack Friday on a Jewish settlement that left two dead, and a Haifa bus 37 massacre which killed 17 civilians.\nAccording to family members, al-Makadmeh anticipated his killing by Israel for his leadership role in Hamas. A few days before his death, he said, \"Our homeland will not be liberated and our people will not be freed from Jewish enslavement and occupation without sacrifices. Freedom has a price, and the price is blood.\"\nThe Israel Defense Forces announced the killing saying that al-Makadmeh \"deserved liquidation\", for \"masterminding terrorist activities against Israeli civilians and soldiers.\" A Hamas spokesman in Gaza dismissed the Israeli allegations as \"cheap lies\", claiming that al-Makadmeh was a political leader.\nIsraeli Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz said that Israel would go after \"other leaders\" from Hamas in the Gaza Strip."}
{"id": "1115036", "revid": "9032616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1115036", "title": "Addis Ababa Bole International Airport", "text": "Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is an international airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is in the Bole district, southeast of the city centre and north of Bishoftu. The airport was formerly known as \"Haile Selassie I International Airport\". It is the main hub of Ethiopian Airlines, the national airline that serves destinations in Ethiopia and throughout the African continent, as well as nonstop service to Asia, Europe, North America and South America. The airport is also the base of the Ethiopian Aviation Academy. As of June 2018, nearly 380 flights per day were departing from and arriving at the airport.\nHistory.\nIn 1960, Ethiopian Airlines realized the runway at Lidetta was too short for its new jet aircraft, the Boeing 720. Thus a new airport was built at Bole.\nBy December 1962 the new runway and control tower were operational. In 1997, an expansion plan was announced for the airport. This expansion was done in three phases:\nThe expanded old runway and the new runway are capable of handling the Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 aircraft. The new parallel runway is connected by five entrances and exits to the old runway, which serves as a taxiway. The terminal houses a high tech security and baggage handling system built on more than 43,000 square meters of land. The terminal also has banks and duty-free shops. The new control tower was built in between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, replacing the old control tower.\nIn 2003, the new international passenger terminal was opened, making it one of Africa's largest airport passenger terminals. The new terminal is capable of handling about 3,000 passengers an hour. This project was worth a total of 1.05 billion birr ($130 million). At the time, the airport was one of a number of airport terminal constructions that have been underway in Ethiopia.\nIn 2006, a new cargo terminal and maintenance hangar was opened five months late. This was because of expanded specifications vastly to improve Ethiopian Airlines' handling capacity and needs. The facility can accommodate three to four aircraft at a time. This project was worth a total of 340 million birr. At the same time, the first Airbus A380 arrived at the airport to undertake tests to validate its Engine Alliance GP7200 engines' performance from high-altitude airports. The airport is capable of accommodating the A380.\nIn 2010, the Ethiopian Airports Enterprise announced another expansion project worth $27.9 million at the airport. The project will include expansion of the aircraft parking capacity from 19 to 44 in order to accommodate heavier aircraft such as the Boeing 747 and Boeing 777. In the first phase of the project, 15 parking stands will be constructed and the remaining will be completed in the next phase. The expansion will help in easing air traffic congestion due to an increase in international travel. This would lead to the new expansion plan in 2012.\nExpansion.\nExpansion of the passenger terminal, cargo space, hangar, the runway and construction of the hotel is currently being completed by Chinese state-owned companies.\nThe expansion work is being undertaken in two phases on an site. The first phase of the expansion work had enabled the airport to accommodate 15 additional aircraft, reducing traffic congestion at the airport. The second phase of the expansion work will enable the airport to service 10 additional aircraft. The airport will be able to service a total of 44 aircraft upon the completion of the expansion. The airport also plans to expand the apron which purportedly can solve the persistent aircraft parking problem it faces particularly during large international conferences.\nIn 2012, expansion of the new passenger terminal was announced. The outlay of this expansion was projected at $250 million. At the same time, a new ramp was completed and can now park 24 aircraft. Another ramp is being built for 14 more aircraft. At the same time, the first phase of expanding the taxiways and adding more aircraft parking was completed. Eventually, this will lead to the expansion of the terminal. This all falls in line with Ethiopian Airlines' plan, \"Vision 2025\".\nAccording to the CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, the east wing of the newly expanded airport was expected to be operational by the end of June 2018. The whole expansion project was completed by the end of 2018, enabling the airport to accommodate up to 22 million passengers per year. As of 23 Jan 2020 the extension is still not fully completed. The new check in area and the elevated road to it are not yet open.\nOn 27 January 2019, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed inaugurated the expansion to Terminal 2.\nFurther developments.\nThe former Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn had purportedly given permission to build a new international airport in the town of Mojo, south of the capital's current airport. The senior official at the Ethiopian Airport Enterprise said that the officials of the enterprise and the Ministry of Transport briefed the Prime Minister about the planned grand airport project. Two other sites are also options.\nFacilities.\nThe airport has two terminals with a total of 11 gates, plus more than 30 remote aircraft parking stands behind both Terminals. Terminal 1 has 4 gates and Terminal 2 has 7 gates. Terminal 1 serves domestic and regional flights for Ethiopian Airlines, EgyptAir, Qatar Airways, Sudan Airways, and Yemenia. Terminal 2 serves international flights and the rest of the airlines that serve the airport.\nIn 2012, Ethiopian Airlines opened the first phase of its Cloud Nine Business Class Lounge at Bole International Airport. This will provide premium travelers with modern facilities and amenities. The second phase of the lounge's construction will include a spa, private digital lockers for passengers to stow away their bags, and a traditional Ethiopian coffee corner. Once complete, it will be three times the size of the existing lounge. Cloud Nine features a quiet corner with sleeping cots and individual reading lamps, massage chairs, and an internet corner with free Wi-Fi connection.

{"id": "1115044", "revid": "57939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1115044", "title": "River Axe (Bristol Channel)", "text": "The River Axe is a river in South West England. The river is formed by water entering swallets in the limestone and rises from the ground at Wookey Hole Caves in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, and runs through a V-shaped valley. The geology of the area is limestone and the water reaches Wookey Hole in a series of underground channels that have eroded through the soluble limestone. The river mouth is in Weston Bay on the Bristol Channel.\nThe river was navigable from the middle ages until 1915, during early centuries of which seeing some European trade.\nGeography.\nThe River Axe is formed by the water entering the cave systems and flows through the third and first chambers, from which it flows to the resurgence, through two sumps and long, where it leaves the cave and enters the open air. It is the second largest resurgence on Mendip, with an estimated catchment area of , and an average discharge of per second. Some of the water is allogenic in origin i.e. drained off non-limestone rocks, collecting as streams on the surface before sinking at or near the Lower Limestone Shale\u00a0\u2014 Black Rock Limestone boundary, often through swallets. One such is Plantation Swallet near St Cuthbert's lead works, between the Hunter's Lodge Inn and Priddy Pools. It then passes through major cave systems such as Swildon's Hole, Eastwater Cavern and St Cuthbert's Swallet, around Priddy, but 95% is water that has percolated directly into the limestone.\nFrom Wookey Hole village the river flows through a ravine and then west through the village of Wookey. There the river bifurcates: the \u2018Lower River Axe\u2019 runs more southerly, towards Henton onto Panborough Moor where it joins a series of rhynes and drains supplying water to local seasonal and perennial wetland, afterwards running north along the westernmost edge of Knowle Moor whilst the Axe proper continues west through the same moor. The two meet, to reunite, where Knowle and Panborough Moors meet.\nThe river then continues northwest past Wedmore Moor and through Oxmoor, Stoke Moor and Monk Moor. The river passes through the settlement of Lower Weare and on to the south of Loxton. From this point until it passes between Uphill Cliff and Brean Down, then reaches the coast at Weston Bay, the river demarcates Sedgemoor from North Somerset.\nTributaries of the Axe include three rivers called Yeo: the Cheddar Yeo, the Mark Yeo and the Lox Yeo.\nHistory.\nThe name derives from a Common Brittonic word meaning \"abounding in fish\", which is also the root for the River Axe in Lyme Bay as well as the Exe, Esk, Usk and other variants. The name is cognate with \"pysg\" (plural of \"pysgod\"), the Welsh word for fish.\nThe lower reaches of the Axe have a history of navigation from the harbour at Uphill through to the settlement of Weare. The current tidal limit of the Axe is the sluice gates at Bleadon and Brean Cross.\nIn the Middle Ages overseas trade was carried out from the port of Rackley, which is now north of the river as the course has been diverted. Rackley is now a farm below Crook Peak and west of Axbridge, which also had wharves. In the 14th century a French ship sailed up the river and by 1388 Thomas Tanner from Wells used Rackley to export cloth and corn to Portugal, and received iron and salt in exchange. Later slate was imported through this route and it may have still be possible to trade through Rackley until the act of 1915 authorising the drainage of the Axe and installation of the flood gate at Bleadon. Bleadon had been a small port, sometimes known as Lympsham Wharf, for many years, with the arrival of the railway in 1841 making this the furthest navigable point. It was last used by the ketch \"Democrat\" in 1942.\nA series of 11 watermills were powered by the river but the only one which remains is at Burcott."}

Mughal emperor Humayun was crowned at this fort. It was later renovated by the Mughal emperor Akbar from 1565 and the present-day structure was completed in 1573. It served as the main residence of the rulers of the Mughal dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was also known as the \"Lal-Qila\" or \"Qila-i-Akbari\". Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its importance during the Mughal Dynasty. It is about northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city. It was later renovated by Shah Jahan. \nLike the rest of Agra, the history of Agra Fort prior to Mahmud of Ghazni's invasion is unclear. However, in the 15th century, the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Khan Lodi (1487\u20131517\u00a0CE) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the preexisting fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (1526\u00a0CE), Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In 1530\u00a0CE, Humayun was crowned in it. The fort was given its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (1556\u20131605\u00a0CE). Later, this fort was under the rule of Jats of Bharatpur for 13\u00a0years.\nHistory.\nAfter the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, Babur stayed in the fort, in the palace of Ibrahim Lodi. He later built a baoli (step well) in it. His successor, Humayun, was crowned in the fort in 1530. He was defeated at Bilgram in 1540 by Sher Shah Suri. The fort remained with the Suris till 1555, when Humayun recaptured it. Adil Shah Suri's general, Hemu, recaptured Agra in 1556 and pursued its fleeing governor to Delhi where he met the Mughals in the Battle of Tughlaqabad.\nRealising the importance of its central situation, Akbar made it his capital and arrived in Agra in 1558. His historian, Abul Fazl, recorded that this was a brick fort known as 'Badalgarh'. It was in a ruined condition and Akbar had it rebuilt with red sandstone from Barauli area Dhaulpur district, in Rajasthan. Architects laid the foundation and it was built with bricks in the inner core with sandstone on external surfaces. Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.\nIt was only during the reign of Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, that the site took on its current state. Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Unlike his grandfather, Shah Jahan tended to have buildings made from white marble. When Aurangzeb was victorious among his all brothers, then he imprisoned Shah Jahan in 1658 in the same fort only.\nThe fort was under the Jat rulers of Bharatpur for 13 years. In the fort, they built the 'Ratan Singh ki Haveli'. The fort was invaded and captured by the Maratha Empire in the early 18th century. Thereafter, it changed hands between the Marathas and their foes many times. After their catastrophic defeat at Third Battle of Panipat by Ahmad Shah Abdali in 1761, Marathas remained out of the region for the next decade. Finally Mahadji Shinde took the fort in 1785. It was lost by the Marathas to the British during the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803. The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857 which caused the end of the British East India Company's rule in India and led to a century of direct rule in India by Britain.\nOn 30 November 1871, thirty six people died when a cartridge factory located inside the fort exploded.\nLayout.\nThe fort has a semicircular plan, its chord lies parallel to the river Yamuna and its walls are seventy feet high. Double ramparts have massive circular bastions at intervals, with battlements, embrasures, machicolations and string courses. Four gates were provided on its four sides, one Khizri gate opening on to the river. Two of the fort's gates are notable: the \"Delhi Gate\" and the \"Lahore Gate.\" The Lahore Gate is also popularly also known as the \"Amar Singh Gate,\" for Amar Singh Rathore.\nThe monumental Delhi Gate, which faces the city on the western side of the fort, is considered the grandest of the four gates and a masterpiece of Akbar's time. It was built circa 1568 both to enhance security and as the king's formal gate, and includes features related to both. It is embellished with intricate inlay work in white marble. A wooden drawbridge was used to cross the moat and reach the gate from the mainland; inside, an inner gateway called Hathi Pol (\"Elephant Gate\") \u2013 guarded by two life-sized stone elephants with their riders \u2013 added another layer of security. The drawbridge, slight ascent, and 90-degree turn between the outer and inner gates make the entrance impregnable. During a siege, attackers would employ elephants to crush a fort's gates. Without a level, straight run-up to gather speed, however, that is prevented by this layout.\nThe northern portion of the fort is still used by the Indian military (the Parachute Brigade in particular), so the Delhi Gate cannot be used by the public. Tourists enter via the Amar Singh Gate.\nThe site is very important in terms of architectural history. Abul Fazal recorded that five hundred buildings in the designs of Bengal and Gujarat were built in the fort. Some of them were demolished by Shah Jahan to make way for his white marble palaces. Most of the others were destroyed by the British troops of East India Company between 1803 and 1862 for raising barracks. Hardly thirty Mughal buildings have survived on the south-eastern side, facing the river, such as the Delhi Gate and Akbar Gate and one palace \u2013 \"Bengali Mahal\".\nAkbar Darwazza (Akbar Gate) was renamed Amar Singh Gate by Shah Jahan. The gate is similar in design to the Delhi Gate. Both are built of red sandstone.\nThe Bengali Mahal is built of red sandstone and is now split into Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal."}

A simple interpretation of the KL divergence of \"P\" from \"Q\" is the expected excess surprise from using \"Q\" as a model when the actual distribution is \"P\". While it is a distance, it is not a metric, the most familiar type of distance: it is not symmetric in the two distributions (in contrast to variation of information), and does not satisfy the triangle inequality. Instead, in terms of information geometry, it is a type of divergence, a generalization of squared distance, and for certain classes of distributions (notably an exponential family), it satisfies a generalized Pythagorean theorem (which applies to squared distances).\nIn the simple case, a relative entropy of 0 indicates that the two distributions in question have identical quantities of information. Relative entropy is a nonnegative function of two distributions or measures. It has diverse applications, both theoretical, such as characterizing the relative (Shannon) entropy in information systems, randomness in continuous time-series, and information gain when comparing statistical models of inference; and practical, such as applied statistics, fluid mechanics, neuroscience and bioinformatics.\nIntroduction and context.\nConsider two probability distributions formula_2 and formula_3. Usually, formula_2 represents the data, the observations, or a measured probability distribution. Distribution formula_3 represents instead a theory, a model, a description or an approximation of formula_2. The Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence is then interpreted as the average difference of the number of bits required for encoding samples of formula_2 using a code optimized for formula_3 rather than one optimized for formula_2. Note that the roles of formula_2 and formula_3 can be reversed in some situations where that is easier to compute, such as with the expectation\u2013maximization algorithm and evidence lower bound computations.\nEtymology.\nThe relative entropy was introduced by Solomon Kullback and Richard Leibler in as \"the mean information for discrimination between formula_12 and formula_13 per observation from formula_14\", where one is comparing two probability measures formula_15, and formula_16 are the hypotheses that one is selecting from measure formula_15 (respectively). They denoted this by formula_18, and defined the \"'divergence' between formula_14 and formula_20\" as the symmetrized quantity formula_21, which had already been defined and used by Harold Jeffreys in 1948. In , the symmetrized form is again referred to as the \"divergence\", and the relative entropies in each direction are referred to as a \"directed divergences\" between two distributions; Kullback preferred the term discrimination information. The term \"divergence\" is in contrast to a distance (metric), since the symmetrized divergence does not satisfy the triangle inequality. Numerous references to earlier uses of the symmetrized divergence and to other statistical distances are given in . The asymmetric \"directed divergence\" has come to be known as the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, while the symmetrized \"divergence\" is now referred to as the Jeffreys divergence.\nDefinition.\nFor discrete probability distributions formula_2 and formula_3 defined on the same sample space, formula_24, the relative entropy from formula_3 to formula_2 is defined to be\nwhich is equivalent to\nIn other words, it is the expectation of the logarithmic difference between the probabilities formula_2 and formula_3, where the expectation is taken using the probabilities formula_2.\nRelative entropy is only defined in this way if, for all formula_32, formula_33 implies formula_34 (absolute continuity). Otherwise, it is often defined as formula_35, but the value formula_35 is possible even if formula_37 everywhere, provided that formula_24 is infinite. Analogous comments apply to the continuous and general measure cases defined below.\nWhenever formula_39 is zero the contribution of the corresponding term is interpreted as zero because\nFor distributions formula_2 and formula_3 of a continuous random variable, relative entropy is defined to be the integral\nwhere formula_44 and formula_45 denote the probability densities of formula_2 and formula_3.\nMore generally, if formula_2 and formula_3 are probability measures on a measurable space formula_50, and formula_2 is absolutely continuous with respect to formula_3, then the relative entropy from formula_3 to formula_2 is defined as\nwhere formula_56 is the Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative of formula_2 with respect to formula_3, i.e. the unique formula_3-almost everywhere defined function formula_60 on formula_24 such that formula_62 which exists because formula_2 is absolutely continuous with respect to formula_3. Also we assume the expression on the right-hand side exists. Equivalently (by the chain rule), this can be written as\nwhich is the entropy of formula_2 relative to formula_3. Continuing in this case, if formula_68 is any measure on formula_24 for which densities formula_44 and formula_45 with formula_72 and formula_73 exist (meaning that formula_2 and formula_3 are both absolutely continuous with respect to formula_68), then the relative entropy from formula_3 to formula_2 is given as\nNote that such a measure formula_68 for which densities can be defined always exists, since one can take formula_81 although in practice it will usually be one that in the context like counting measure for discrete distributions, or Lebesgue measure or a convenient variant thereof like Gaussian measure or the uniform measure on the sphere, Haar measure on a Lie group etc. for continuous distributions. \nThe logarithms in these formulae are usually taken to base 2 if information is measured in units of bits, or to base formula_82 if information is measured in nats. Most formulas involving relative entropy hold regardless of the base of the logarithm.\nVarious conventions exist for referring to formula_1 in words. Often it is referred to as the divergence \"between\" formula_2 and formula_3, but this fails to convey the fundamental asymmetry in the relation. Sometimes, as in this article, it may be described as the divergence of formula_2 \"from\" formula_3 or as the divergence \"from\" formula_3 \"to\" formula_2. This reflects the asymmetry in Bayesian inference, which starts \"from\" a prior formula_3 and updates \"to\" the posterior formula_2. Another common way to refer to formula_1 is as the relative entropy of formula_2 \"with respect to\" formula_3 or the information gain from formula_2 over formula_3.\nBasic example.\nKullback gives the following example (Table 2.1, Example 2.1). Let and be the distributions shown in the table and figure. is the distribution on the left side of the figure, a binomial distribution with formula_97 and formula_98. is the distribution on the right side of the figure, a discrete uniform distribution with the three possible outcomes formula_99 , , (i.e. formula_100), each with probability formula_101.\nRelative entropies formula_1 and formula_103 are calculated as follows. This example uses the natural log with base \"e\", designated to get results in nats (see units of information):\nInterpretations.\nStatistics.\nIn the field of statistics, the Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma states that the most powerful way to distinguish between the two distributions formula_2 and formula_3 based on an observation formula_108 (drawn from one of them) is through the log of the ratio of their likelihoods: formula_109. The KL divergence is the expected value of this statistic if formula_108 is actually drawn from formula_2. Kullback motivated the statistic as an expected log likelihood ratio.\nCoding.\nIn the context of coding theory, formula_1 can be constructed by measuring the expected number of extra bits required to code samples from formula_2 using a code optimized for formula_3 rather than the code optimized for formula_2.\nInference.\nIn the context of machine learning, formula_1 is often called the information gain achieved if formula_2 would be used instead of formula_3 which is currently used. By analogy with information theory, it is called the \"relative entropy\" of formula_2 with respect to formula_3.\nExpressed in the language of Bayesian inference, formula_1 is a measure of the information gained by revising one's beliefs from the prior probability distribution formula_3 to the posterior probability distribution formula_2. In other words, it is the amount of information lost when formula_3 is used to approximate formula_2.\nInformation geometry.\nIn applications, formula_2 typically represents the \"true\" distribution of data, observations, or a precisely calculated theoretical distribution, while formula_3 typically represents a theory, model, description, or approximation of formula_2. In order to find a distribution formula_3 that is closest to formula_2, we can minimize the KL divergence and compute an information projection.\nWhile it is a statistical distance, it is not a metric, the most familiar type of distance, but instead it is a divergence. While metrics are symmetric and generalize \"linear\" distance, satisfying the triangle inequality, divergences are asymmetric and generalize \"squared\" distance, in some cases satisfying a generalized Pythagorean theorem. In general formula_1 does not equal formula_103, and the asymmetry is an important part of the geometry. The infinitesimal form of relative entropy, specifically its Hessian, gives a metric tensor that equals the Fisher information metric; see . Relative entropy satisfies a generalized Pythagorean theorem for exponential families (geometrically interpreted as dually flat manifolds), and this allows one to minimize relative entropy by geometric means, for example by information projection and in maximum likelihood estimation.\nRelative entropy is a special case of a broader class of statistical divergences called \"f\"-divergences as well as the class of Bregman divergences, and it is the only such divergence over probabilities that is a member of both classes.\nFinance (game theory).\nConsider a growth-optimizing investor in a fair game with mutually exclusive outcomes \n(e.g. a \u201chorse race\u201d in which the official odds add up to one).\nThe rate of return expected by such an investor is equal to the relative entropy \nbetween the investor\u2019s believed probabilities and the official odds.\nThis is a special case of a much more general connection between financial returns and divergence measures.\nFinancial risks are connected to formula_133 via information geometry. Investors' views, the prevailing market view, and risky scenarios form triangles on the relevant manifold of probability distributions. The shape of the triangles determines key financial risks (both qualitatively and quantitatively). For instance, obtuse triangles in which investors' views and risk scenarios appear on \u201copposite sides\u201d relative to the market describe negative risks, acute triangles describe positive exposure, and the right-angled situation in the middle corresponds to zero risk.\nMotivation.\nIn information theory, the Kraft\u2013McMillan theorem establishes that any directly decodable coding scheme for coding a message to identify one value formula_134 out of a set of possibilities formula_135 can be seen as representing an implicit probability distribution formula_136 over formula_135, where formula_138 is the length of the code for formula_134 in bits. Therefore, relative entropy can be interpreted as the expected extra message-length per datum that must be communicated if a code that is optimal for a given (wrong) distribution formula_3 is used, compared to using a code based on the true distribution formula_2: it is the \"excess\" entropy.\nwhere formula_143 is the cross entropy of formula_2 and formula_3, and formula_146 is the entropy of formula_2 (which is the same as the cross-entropy of P with itself).\nThe relative entropy formula_1 can be thought of geometrically as a statistical distance, a measure of how far the distribution \"Q\" is from the distribution \"P\". Geometrically it is a divergence: an asymmetric, generalized form of squared distance. The cross-entropy formula_149 is itself such a measurement (formally a loss function), but it cannot be thought of as a distance, since formula_150 isn't zero. This can be fixed by subtracting formula_151 to make formula_1 agree more closely with our notion of distance, as the \"excess\" loss. The resulting function is asymmetric, and while this can be symmetrized (see ), the asymmetric form is more useful. See for more on the geometric interpretation.\nRelative entropy relates to \"rate function\" in the theory of large deviations.\nArthur Hobson proved that relative entropy is the only measure of difference between probability distributions that satisfies some desired properties, which are the canonical extension to those appearing in a commonly used characterization of entropy. Consequently, mutual information is the only measure of mutual dependence that obeys certain related conditions, since it can be defined in terms of Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence.\nProperties.\nIn particular, if formula_156 and formula_73, then formula_158 formula_68-almost everywhere. The entropy formula_146 thus sets a minimum value for the cross-entropy formula_161, the expected number of bits required when using a code based on formula_3 rather than formula_2; and the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence therefore represents the expected number of extra bits that must be transmitted to identify a value formula_32 drawn from formula_135, if a code is used corresponding to the probability distribution formula_3, rather than the \"true\" distribution formula_2.\nDuality formula for variational inference.\nThe following result, due to Donsker and Varadhan, is known as Donsker and Varadhan's variational formula.\nFor alternative proof using measure theory, see.\nExamples.\nMultivariate normal distributions.\nSuppose that we have two multivariate normal distributions, with means formula_193 and with (non-singular) covariance matrices formula_194 If the two distributions have the same dimension, formula_195, then the relative entropy between the distributions is as follows:\nThe logarithm in the last term must be taken to base \"e\" since all terms apart from the last are base-\"e\" logarithms of expressions that are either factors of the density function or otherwise arise naturally. The equation therefore gives a result measured in nats. Dividing the entire expression above by formula_197 yields the divergence in bits.\nIn a numerical implementation, it is helpful to express the result in terms of the Cholesky decompositions formula_198 such that formula_199 and formula_200. Then with formula_201 and formula_202 solutions to the triangular linear systems formula_203, and formula_204,\nA special case, and a common quantity in variational inference, is the relative entropy between a diagonal multivariate normal, and a standard normal distribution (with zero mean and unit variance):\nFor two univariate normal distributions p and q the above simplifies to\nIn the case of co-centered normal distributions with formula_208, this simplifies to:\nformula_209\nUniform distributions.\nConsider two uniform distributions, with the support of formula_210 enclosed within formula_211 (formula_212\nIntuitively, the information gain to a formula_195 times narrower uniform distribution contains formula_214 bits. This connects with the use of bits in computing, where formula_215 bits would be needed to identify one element of a formula_195 long stream.\nRelation to metrics.\nWhile relative entropy is a statistical distance, it is not a metric on the space of probability distributions, but instead it is a divergence. While metrics are symmetric and generalize \"linear\" distance, satisfying the triangle inequality, divergences are asymmetric in general and generalize \"squared\" distance, in some cases satisfying a generalized Pythagorean theorem. In general formula_1 does not equal formula_103, and while this can be symmetrized (see ), the asymmetry is an important part of the geometry.\nIt generates a topology on the space of probability distributions. More concretely, if formula_219 is a sequence of distributions such that\nthen it is said that\nPinsker's inequality entails that\nwhere the latter stands for the usual convergence in total variation.\nFisher information metric.\nRelative entropy is directly related to the Fisher information metric. This can be made explicit as follows. Assume that the probability distributions formula_2 and formula_3 are both parameterized by some (possibly multi-dimensional) parameter formula_225. Consider then two close by values of formula_226 and formula_227 so that the parameter formula_225 differs by only a small amount from the parameter value formula_229. Specifically, up to first order one has (using the Einstein summation convention)\nwith formula_231 a small change of formula_225 in the formula_233 direction, and formula_234 the corresponding rate of change in the probability distribution. Since relative entropy has an absolute minimum 0 for formula_155, i.e. formula_236, it changes only to \"second\" order in the small parameters formula_237. More formally, as for any minimum, the first derivatives of the divergence vanish\nand by the Taylor expansion one has up to second order\nwhere the Hessian matrix of the divergence\nmust be positive semidefinite. Letting formula_229 vary (and dropping the subindex 0) the Hessian formula_242 defines a (possibly degenerate) Riemannian metric on the parameter space, called the Fisher information metric.\nFisher information metric theorem.\nWhen formula_243 satisfies the following regularity conditions:\nwhere is independent of \nthen:\nVariation of information.\nAnother information-theoretic metric is variation of information, which is roughly a symmetrization of conditional entropy. It is a metric on the set of partitions of a discrete probability space.\nRelation to other quantities of information theory.\nMany of the other quantities of information theory can be interpreted as applications of relative entropy to specific cases.\nSelf-information.\nThe self-information, also known as the information content of a signal, random variable, or event is defined as the negative logarithm of the probability of the given outcome occurring.\nWhen applied to a discrete random variable, the self-information can be represented as\nis the relative entropy of the probability distribution formula_249 from a Kronecker delta representing certainty that formula_250 \u2014 i.e. the number of extra bits that must be transmitted to identify formula_251 if only the probability distribution formula_249 is available to the receiver, not the fact that formula_250.\nMutual information.\nThe mutual information,\nis the relative entropy of the product formula_255 of the two marginal probability distributions from the joint probability distribution formula_256 \u2014 i.e. the expected number of extra bits that must be transmitted to identify formula_135 and formula_108 if they are coded using only their marginal distributions instead of the joint distribution. Equivalently, if the joint probability formula_256 \"is\" known, it is the expected number of extra bits that must on average be sent to identify formula_108 if the value of formula_135 is not already known to the receiver.\nShannon entropy.\nThe Shannon entropy,\nis the number of bits which would have to be transmitted to identify formula_135 from formula_264 equally likely possibilities, \"less\" the relative entropy of the uniform distribution on the random variates of formula_135, formula_266, from the true distribution formula_267 \u2014 i.e. \"less\" the expected number of bits saved, which would have had to be sent if the value of formula_135 were coded according to the uniform distribution formula_266 rather than the true distribution formula_267. This definition of Shannon entropy forms the basis of E.T. Jaynes's alternative generalization to continuous distributions, the limiting density of discrete points (as opposed to the usual differential entropy), which defines the continuous entropy as \nwhich is equivalent to:\nConditional entropy.\nThe conditional entropy,\nis the number of bits which would have to be transmitted to identify formula_135 from formula_264 equally likely possibilities, \"less\" the relative entropy of the product distribution formula_276 from the true joint distribution formula_256 \u2014 i.e. \"less\" the expected number of bits saved which would have had to be sent if the value of formula_135 were coded according to the uniform distribution formula_266 rather than the conditional distribution formula_280 of formula_135 given formula_108.\nCross entropy.\nWhen we have a set of possible events, coming from the distribution , we can encode them (with a lossless data compression) using entropy encoding. This compresses the data by replacing each fixed-length input symbol with a corresponding unique, variable-length, prefix-free code (e.g.: the events (A, B, C) with probabilities p = (1/2, 1/4, 1/4) can be encoded as the bits (0, 10, 11)). If we know the distribution in advance, we can devise an encoding that would be optimal (e.g.: using Huffman coding). Meaning the messages we encode will have the shortest length on average (assuming the encoded events are sampled from ), which will be equal to Shannon's Entropy of (denoted as formula_283). However, if we use a different probability distribution () when creating the entropy encoding scheme, then a larger number of bits will be used (on average) to identify an event from a set of possibilities. This new (larger) number is measured by the cross entropy between and .\nThe cross entropy between two probability distributions ( and ) measures the average number of bits needed to identify an event from a set of possibilities, if a coding scheme is used based on a given probability distribution , rather than the \"true\" distribution . The cross entropy for two distributions and over the same probability space is thus defined as follows.\nFor explicit derivation of this, see the Motivation section above.\nUnder this scenario, relative entropies (kl-divergence) can be interpreted as the extra number of bits, on average, that are needed (beyond formula_283) for encoding the events because of using for constructing the encoding scheme instead of .\nBayesian updating.\nIn Bayesian statistics, relative entropy can be used as a measure of the information gain in moving from a prior distribution to a posterior distribution: formula_286. If some new fact formula_287 is discovered, it can be used to update the posterior distribution for formula_135 from formula_289 to a new posterior distribution formula_290 using Bayes' theorem:\nThis distribution has a new entropy:\nwhich may be less than or greater than the original entropy formula_293. However, from the standpoint of the new probability distribution one can estimate that to have used the original code based on formula_289 instead of a new code based on formula_295 would have added an expected number of bits:\nto the message length. This therefore represents the amount of useful information, or information gain, about formula_135, that has been learned by discovering formula_287.\nIf a further piece of data, formula_299, subsequently comes in, the probability distribution for formula_32 can be updated further, to give a new best guess formula_301. If one reinvestigates the information gain for using formula_302 rather than formula_303, it turns out that it may be either greater or less than previously estimated:\nand so the combined information gain does \"not\" obey the triangle inequality:\nAll one can say is that on \"average\", averaging using formula_308, the two sides will average out.\nBayesian experimental design.\nA common goal in Bayesian experimental design is to maximise the expected relative entropy between the prior and the posterior. When posteriors are approximated to be Gaussian distributions, a design maximising the expected relative entropy is called Bayes d-optimal.\nDiscrimination information.\nRelative entropy formula_309 can also be interpreted as the expected discrimination information for formula_12 over formula_311: the mean information per sample for discriminating in favor of a hypothesis formula_12 against a hypothesis formula_311, when hypothesis formula_12 is true. Another name for this quantity, given to it by I. J. Good, is the expected weight of evidence for formula_12 over formula_311 to be expected from each sample.\nThe expected weight of evidence for formula_12 over formula_311 is not the same as the information gain expected per sample about the probability distribution formula_319 of the hypotheses,\nEither of the two quantities can be used as a utility function in Bayesian experimental design, to choose an optimal next question to investigate: but they will in general lead to rather different experimental strategies.\nOn the entropy scale of \"information gain\" there is very little difference between near certainty and absolute certainty\u2014coding according to a near certainty requires hardly any more bits than coding according to an absolute certainty. On the other hand, on the logit scale implied by weight of evidence, the difference between the two is enormous \u2013 infinite perhaps; this might reflect the difference between being almost sure (on a probabilistic level) that, say, the Riemann hypothesis is correct, compared to being certain that it is correct because one has a mathematical proof. These two different scales of loss function for uncertainty are \"both\" useful, according to how well each reflects the particular circumstances of the problem in question.\nPrinciple of minimum discrimination information.\nThe idea of relative entropy as discrimination information led Kullback to propose the Principle of (MDI): given new facts, a new distribution formula_321 should be chosen which is as hard to discriminate from the original distribution formula_322 as possible; so that the new data produces as small an information gain formula_323 as possible.\nFor example, if one had a prior distribution formula_324 over formula_32 and formula_326, and subsequently learnt the true distribution of formula_326 was formula_328, then the relative entropy between the new joint distribution for formula_32 and formula_326, formula_331, and the earlier prior distribution would be:\ni.e. the sum of the relative entropy of formula_333 the prior distribution for formula_326 from the updated distribution formula_328, plus the expected value (using the probability distribution formula_328) of the relative entropy of the prior conditional distribution formula_337 from the new conditional distribution formula_338. (Note that often the later expected value is called the \"conditional relative entropy\" (or \"conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence\") and denoted by formula_339\n) This is minimized if formula_340 over the whole support of formula_328; and we note that this result incorporates Bayes' theorem, if the new distribution formula_328 is in fact a \u03b4 function representing certainty that formula_326 has one particular value.\nMDI can be seen as an extension of Laplace's Principle of Insufficient Reason, and the Principle of Maximum Entropy of E.T. Jaynes. In particular, it is the natural extension of the principle of maximum entropy from discrete to continuous distributions, for which Shannon entropy ceases to be so useful (see \"differential entropy\"), but the relative entropy continues to be just as relevant.\nIn the engineering literature, MDI is sometimes called the Principle of Minimum Cross-Entropy (MCE) or Minxent for short. Minimising relative entropy from formula_344 to formula_44 with respect to formula_344 is equivalent to minimizing the cross-entropy of formula_44 and formula_344, since\nwhich is appropriate if one is trying to choose an adequate approximation to formula_44. However, this is just as often \"not\" the task one is trying to achieve. Instead, just as often it is formula_344 that is some fixed prior reference measure, and formula_44 that one is attempting to optimise by minimising formula_353 subject to some constraint. This has led to some ambiguity in the literature, with some authors attempting to resolve the inconsistency by redefining cross-entropy to be formula_353, rather than formula_355 .\nRelationship to available work.\nSurprisals add where probabilities multiply. The surprisal for an event of probability formula_44 is defined as formula_357. If formula_195 is formula_359 then surprisal is in formula_360nats, bits, or formula_361 so that, for instance, there are formula_264 bits of surprisal for landing all \"heads\" on a toss of formula_264 coins.\nBest-guess states (e.g. for atoms in a gas) are inferred by maximizing the \"average surprisal\" formula_364 (entropy) for a given set of control parameters (like pressure formula_2 or volume formula_366). This constrained entropy maximization, both classically and quantum mechanically, minimizes Gibbs availability in entropy units formula_367 where formula_368 is a constrained multiplicity or partition function.\nWhen temperature formula_369 is fixed, free energy (formula_370) is also minimized. Thus if formula_371 and number of molecules formula_264 are constant, the Helmholtz free energy formula_373 (where formula_374 is energy and formula_364 is entropy) is minimized as a system \"equilibrates.\" If formula_369 and formula_2 are held constant (say during processes in your body), the Gibbs free energy formula_378 is minimized instead. The change in free energy under these conditions is a measure of available work that might be done in the process. Thus available work for an ideal gas at constant temperature formula_379 and pressure formula_380 is formula_381 where formula_382 and formula_383 (see also Gibbs inequality).\nMore generally the work available relative to some ambient is obtained by multiplying ambient temperature formula_379 by relative entropy or \"net surprisal\" formula_385 defined as the average value of formula_386 where formula_387 is the probability of a given state under ambient conditions. For instance, the work available in equilibrating a monatomic ideal gas to ambient values of formula_388 and formula_379 is thus formula_390, where relative entropy\nThe resulting contours of constant relative entropy, shown at right for a mole of Argon at standard temperature and pressure, for example put limits on the conversion of hot to cold as in flame-powered air-conditioning or in the unpowered device to convert boiling-water to ice-water discussed here. Thus relative entropy measures thermodynamic availability in bits.\nQuantum information theory.\nFor density matrices formula_2 and formula_3 on a Hilbert space, the quantum relative entropy from formula_3 to formula_2 is defined to be\nIn quantum information science the minimum of formula_397 over all separable states formula_3 can also be used as a measure of entanglement in the state formula_2.\nRelationship between models and reality.\nJust as relative entropy of \"actual from ambient\" measures thermodynamic availability, relative entropy of \"reality from a model\" is also useful even if the only clues we have about reality are some experimental measurements. In the former case relative entropy describes \"distance to equilibrium\" or (when multiplied by ambient temperature) the amount of \"available work\", while in the latter case it tells you about surprises that reality has up its sleeve or, in other words, \"how much the model has yet to learn\".\nAlthough this tool for evaluating models against systems that are accessible experimentally may be applied in any field, its application to selecting a statistical model via Akaike information criterion are particularly well described in papers and a book by Burnham and Anderson. In a nutshell the relative entropy of reality from a model may be estimated, to within a constant additive term, by a function of the deviations observed between data and the model's predictions (like the mean squared deviation) . Estimates of such divergence for models that share the same additive term can in turn be used to select among models.\nWhen trying to fit parametrized models to data there are various estimators which attempt to minimize relative entropy, such as maximum likelihood and maximum spacing estimators.\nSymmetrised divergence.\nalso considered the symmetrized function:\nwhich they referred to as the \"divergence\", though today the \"KL divergence\" refers to the asymmetric function (see for the evolution of the term). This function is symmetric and nonnegative, and had already been defined and used by Harold Jeffreys in 1948; it is accordingly called the Jeffreys divergence.\nThis quantity has sometimes been used for feature selection in classification problems, where formula_2 and formula_3 are the conditional pdfs of a feature under two different classes. In the Banking and Finance industries, this quantity is referred to as Population Stability Index (PSI), and is used to assess distributional shifts in model features through time.\nAn alternative is given via the formula_403-divergence,\nwhich can be interpreted as the expected information gain about formula_135 from discovering which probability distribution formula_135 is drawn from, formula_2 or formula_3, if they currently have probabilities formula_403 and formula_410 respectively. \nThe value formula_411 gives the Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence, defined by\nwhere formula_201 is the average of the two distributions,\nWe can also interpret formula_415 as the capacity of a noisy information channel with two inputs giving the output distributions formula_2 and formula_3. The Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence, like all \"f\"-divergences, is \"locally\" proportional to the Fisher information metric. It is similar to the Hellinger metric (in the sense that it induces the same affine connection on a statistical manifold).\nFurthermore, the Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence can be generalized using abstract statistical M-mixtures relying on an abstract mean M.\nRelationship to other probability-distance measures.\nThere are many other important measures of probability distance. Some of these are particularly connected with relative entropy. For example:\nOther notable measures of distance include the Hellinger distance, \"histogram intersection\", \"Chi-squared statistic\", \"quadratic form distance\", \"match distance\", \"Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov distance\", and \"earth mover's distance\".\nData differencing.\nJust as \"absolute\" entropy serves as theoretical background for data \"compression\", \"relative\" entropy serves as theoretical background for data \"differencing\" \u2013 the absolute entropy of a set of data in this sense being the data required to reconstruct it (minimum compressed size), while the relative entropy of a target set of data, given a source set of data, is the data required to reconstruct the target \"given\" the source (minimum size of a patch)."}

It runs from St Stephen's Green in the south (at the highest point of the street) to College Green in the north (the lowest point). \nThe street, on the Southside of the city, was developed from a laneway in the early 1700s, and its line was shaped by the now-culverted River Steyne. Initially, a fashionable residential street with some commercial activity, the character of Grafton Street changed after it was connected to Carlisle Bridge and came to form part of a cross-city route. It suffered from dilapidation and prostitution through the 19th century, with several run-down buildings. During the 20th century, it became known for the coffee house Bewley's, mid- and up-market shopping, and as a popular spot for buskers. It has been assessed as one of the most expensive main retail streets in the world on which to rent.\nName.\nThe street was named after Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, the illegitimate grandson of King Charles II, who owned land in the area. His father, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, died on 9 October 1690 following the Siege of Cork. The second duke was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1721 to 1724.\nHistory.\nEarly development.\nThe street was developed from an existing country lane, connecting College Green to St Stephen's Green, which had been worked on by the Dawson family, after whom the parallel Dawson Street is named. It was developed and widened through the early 1700s, starting in 1708. Four years later, the city's governing body, Dublin Corporation, approved development along the street in order to make a \"crown causeway\". Its line was shaped by the short culverted River Steyne, which rises on one side of St Stephen's Green and flows towards College Green and the Liffey near O'Connell Bridge. Development was largely complete by 1727.\nFrom the beginning, the street held a mixture of residential and commercial development. Advertisements from the 1750s and 1760s describe first-floor apartments featuring a dining room, bedchamber and closet. The theatre manager Louis Du Val lived in Grafton Street in 1733, as did the novelist Charles Robert Maturin's family. \nThe street was largely rebuilt in the late 1700s, following the completion of Carlisle Bridge (now O'Connell Bridge) in 1758, spanning the River Liffey, when Grafton Street came to form part of an important north-south thoroughfare. Many of the remaining residences were redeveloped into shops, and several taverns were established along the street. This was supplemented by the widening and rebuilding which took place as part of the work of the Wide Streets Commission, from 1841. By the latter part of the 19th century, the street was primarily commercial in nature.\n19th century.\nThroughout the 19th century, Grafton Street became increasingly dilapidated. By 1849, several buildings had broken windows that were patched up with paper. In 1862, the \"Dublin Builder\" said the street \"abounds in old premises in need of doctoring up.\" During the late 19th century, a number of retail properties were built and several long standing businesses established their presence on the street, such as the department stores Switzer's and Brown Thomas. The jewellers Weirs opened in 1869.\nThe street became known for prostitution during this time; in the 1870s, 1,500 prostitutes were reputed to work the street. This was part of a broader phenomenon \u2212 in 1870, there were 3,255 arrests for prostitution in Dublin, compared to 2,183 in London and 1,617 in Manchester. Despite complaints that the street was \"impassable to virtuous women\", Dublin tourist guides continued to mention it as a fashionable place to visit. By the turn of the 20th century, prostitution had moved to the Montgomery Street (\"Monto\") area on the northern side of the city, somewhat allowing Grafton Street's reputation to recover.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nIn 1911, King George V and Queen Mary were led in a procession down Grafton Street which attracted thousands of onlookers. The American chain, Woolworth's, opened a store the street in 1914.\nAs part of a wider set of proposals to rename a number of Dublin streets in 1921, it was proposed that Grafton Street be renamed Grattan Street in the \"Report of the Paving Committee\" by the Dublin Corporation street naming committee. This new naming scheme was not fully implemented. Among the names retained alongside Grafton Street were North Earl Street and Talbot Street. This new name for Grafton Street had first been proposed by a columnist in \"The Irishman\" newspaper in 1862.\nThe Dublin branch of Woolworth's opened on Nos.\u00a065\u201368 in 1948. The first Irish McDonald's restaurant opened on the street in 1977. This was followed by the opening of a number of other UK high street businesses in the 1980s including HMV, Next, River Island, Miss Selfridge, and Marks &amp; Spencer. In 1987, a major fire broke out on Grafton Street in an employment agency above two shops. The fire quickly spread through the property, causing significant damage and closing the street. Five people were hospitalised for shock and smoke inhalation.\nSeveral properties on the street were refurbished in the 1990s. No.\u00a070 was extended in 1992, adding a limestone frontage on the ground floor. Numbers 84\u201386 were rebuilt the same year in a postmodern brick style.\nIn 2008, Grafton Street was the fifth most expensive main shopping street in the world, with rental pricing of \u20ac5,621/m2/year, and the thirteenth most expensive main shopping street in the world in 2016 at rental pricing of a much lower region of \u20ac3,300/m2/year.\nPedestrianisation.\nBy the 1960s, Grafton Street had become congested with cars and buses, which caused serious pollution.\nPedestrianisation of the street was first trialled in September 1971, for a period of 4 weeks. After many delays, permanent pedestrianisation of most of the street was established in 1982, and the street was then repaved in 1988, with new street lighting also fitted. Objections to pedestrianisation came from councillors and small business owners, who alleged that it would lead to an increase in petty crime and antisocial behaviour. The northern end of the street, between Nassau Street and College Green, one side of which is occupied by the walls of Trinity College, is not pedestrianised.\nProperties.\nGrafton Street has had a number of periods of redevelopment in its history, including in the 1860s, 1880s, early 1900s, and 1990s. On some occasions, the demolition of buildings led to the collapse of some of their neighbour's. Altogether, this activity has resulted in a mixture of periods and styles, with few notable interiors or street surfaces extant. Some of the Georgian plot sizes and facades are still visible on some buildings, such as Nos. 31\u201333 and 63. No. 14 retains the window pattern of an early \"Dutch Billy\" house. At the north end of Grafton Street, surviving largely intact, is the Provost's House, Trinity College, home to the head of the college and the University of Dublin.\nThe English Grammar School was founded at No.\u00a075 Grafton Street in 1758, by Samuel Whyte, first cousin in law of the actor and impresario Thomas Sheridan. Students included Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Robert Emmet, Thomas Moore and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. It closed in 1824. Hodges Figgis first bookshop was at 104 Grafton Street, opening in 1797. It moved to its current location in Dawson Street in 1920.\nBewley's Oriental Caf\u00e9 opened on Grafton Street in 1927, on the site of Whyte's Academy, and became a popular place to gather and socialise. In 2004, it was announced that Bewley's Grafton Street and Westmoreland Street caf\u00e9s would close, putting 243 jobs at risk. Following a campaign, the caf\u00e9 on Grafton Street, which had closed, was reopened. Subject to a \u20ac1m redevelopment scheme in 2015, the caf\u00e9 closed again following a collapse of trade during the COVID-19 pandemic. The then mayor, Tom Brabazon, expressed a hope that it might re-open after the pandemic.\nMonuments.\nThe northern end of the street was for many years the location of the Molly Malone statue, a well-known tourist attraction and meeting-place. The statue was moved from Grafton Street to nearby Suffolk Street in 2014, to make way for an extension to the Luas tram system, which runs along the northern part of Grafton Street. \nA life-size bronze statue of Dublin musician and leader of Thin Lizzy, Phil Lynott, was unveiled on Harry Street, off Grafton Street near the Stephen's Green end, in August 2005. In May 2013, the statue was tipped over by two vandals, who were subsequently arrested. In 2017, it was damaged after being hit by a truck, and spent several months in repair. The statue has become a well-known tourist attraction for music fans. In keeping with the tendency for Dubliners to nickname statues, it is known to locals as the \"Ace with the Bass\".\nGrafton Street is normally lit with Christmas lights during the festive season \u2014 in 2022, it was estimated that around 300,000 bulbs were used in illuminating the street. In 2019, a planned \"Nollaig Shona Duit\" (Irish for \"Happy Christmas\") light display was cancelled and replaced with \"Grafton Quarter\" signage, causing controversy.\nBusking.\nSince the 1980s, Grafton Street has become internationally known for its street entertainment, particularly busking. Musicians, poets and mime artists commonly perform to the shopping crowds. This was portrayed in the opening scene of the 2007 film \"Once\", starring Glen Hansard of the Frames, a former Grafton Street busker. In Dublin, street performers must pay for a licence to busk (\u20ac30 per year as of 2019, plus \u20ac60 if using amplification), and on Grafton Street, each such performance is restricted to a maximum of one hour, and a musician cannot play within a distance of that location until the following day.\nGrafton Street buskers have included:\nReferences.\nCitations\nSources"}

Her execution in the electric chair at New York's Sing Sing Prison in 1928 for the murder of her husband, Albert Snyder, was recorded in a highly publicized photograph.\nMurder of Albert Snyder.\nMay Ruth Brown met Albert Edward Snyder (n\u00e9 Schneider) in 1915 in New York City, when she was 20 years old and he was a 33-year-old artist. The couple had little in common; Brown, who went by her middle name Ruth to most people and was known as \"Tommy\" to close friends, was described as vivacious and gregarious, while Snyder was described as very reserved and a \"homebody\". Despite their differences in personalities and age, the couple married and settled in a modest house in Queens. In 1918, Ruth gave birth to their only child, a daughter named Lorraine. Albert Snyder worked as an art editor for \"Motor Boating\" magazine, published for most of its run by Hearst Magazines, and made one-hundred dollars a week.\nIn 1925, Ruth began an affair with Henry Judd Gray, a married corset salesman who lived in the New Jersey suburbs. She began to plan the murder of her husband Albert, enlisting Gray's help, but he was reluctant. Some claim that Ruth's distaste for her husband apparently began when he insisted on hanging a picture of his late fianc\u00e9e, Jessie Guischard, on the wall of their first home and named his boat after her. Guischard, whom Albert described to Ruth as \"the finest woman I have ever met\", had been dead for 10 years. However, others have noted that Albert Snyder was emotionally and physically abusive, blaming Ruth for the birth of a daughter rather than a son, demanding a perfectly maintained home, and physically assaulting both her and their daughter Lorraine when his demands were not met.\nRuth first persuaded Albert to purchase insurance, and with the assistance of an insurance agent (who was subsequently fired and sent to prison for forgery), \"signed\" a $48,000 life insurance policy that paid extra if an unexpected act of violence killed the victim. According to Gray, Ruth had made at least seven attempts to kill Albert, all of which he survived. On March 20, 1927, the couple garrotted Albert with a picture wire, stuffed his nose full of chloroform-soaked rags, and beat him with a sash weight, then staged his death as part of a burglary. Detectives at the scene noted that the burglar left little evidence of breaking into the house. Moreover, Ruth's behavior was inconsistent with her story of a terrorized wife witnessing her husband being killed.\nPolice discovered that the property Ruth had claimed had been stolen was still in the house, but hidden. A breakthrough came when a detective found a paper with the letters J.G. on it (it was a memento Albert had kept from former lover Guischard) and asked Ruth about it. A flustered Ruth's mind immediately turned to Gray, whose initials were also J.G., and she asked the detective what Gray had to do with the murder. It was the first time Gray had been mentioned, and the police instantly became suspicious. Gray was found in Syracuse, New York. He claimed he had been there all night, but it was found out that a friend of his had set up Gray's room at a hotel to support his alibi. Gray proved far more forthcoming than Ruth about his actions. He was caught, returned to Queens, and charged along with Ruth.\nThe trial.\nRuth and Gray turned on each other, contending the other was responsible for killing Albert; both were convicted and sentenced to death.\nExecution.\nRuth was imprisoned at Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. On January 12, 1928, she became the first woman to be executed at Sing Sing since Martha Place in 1899. She went to the electric chair 10 minutes before Judd Gray, her former lover. Her execution (by New York State Electrician Robert G. Elliott) was surreptitiously photographed at the moment electricity was running through her body with the aid of a miniature plate camera strapped to the ankle of Tom Howard, a \"Chicago Tribune\" photographer working in cooperation with the \"Tribune\"-owned \"Daily News\". Howard's camera later was owned by inventor Miller Reese Hutchison and later became part of the collections of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.\nRuth was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. Her footstone reads \"May R.\" and includes her date of death. Gray was interred in Rosedale Cemetery in Montclair, New Jersey.\nLorraine Snyder.\nFollowing the pronouncement of the death sentence on Ruth Snyder in May 1927, legal disputes arose between the relatives regarding the care of Ruth and Albert's daughter, Lorraine, who was nine years old at the time. Warren Schneider, brother of Albert, petitioned to be allowed to appoint a legal guardian who was not a member of Ruth's family. Josephine Brown, mother of Ruth, also petitioned for custody of the girl. Lorraine had been in the care of Brown since the murder. Lorraine was formally placed by her maternal grandmother in the Catholic institution where she had been residing at the time of her mother's execution. Ruth requested that her daughter not be brought to the prison for a final visit.\nOn September 7, 1927, Josephine Brown was awarded guardianship of the girl. During this time, there were disputes with the insurance company Ruth had used to insure her husband's life. Although one policy, worth US$30,000, to Gray's daughter, was paid without contest, they filed suit to void two other policies, worth $45,000 and $5,000 (the three combined policies worth $ million in ). By May 1928, the insurance company made available $4,000 for the maintenance of Lorraine. In November 1928 a ruling in the case was reached, with a court finding the policies could not be collected because they had been issued fraudulently. At the time of the judgment, the lawyer acting on behalf of Ruth's family asked the court to allow them to appeal without a printed record on the basis that the family was destitute and unable to sell the house due to the notoriety of the case. By May 1930, it was ruled on appeal that the two policies were invalid.\nWhile incarcerated on death row, Ruth Snyder wrote a sealed letter which she requested be given to Lorraine \"when she is old enough to understand\". One year after her mother's execution, Lorraine was apparently aware that her parents were both dead, but not of the manner of either of their deaths."}

It began as Tamarind Lithography Workshop, a California non-profit corporation founded by June Wayne on Tamarind Avenue in Los Angeles in 1960. Both the current Institute and the original Lithography Workshop are referred to informally as \"Tamarind.\"\nOrigin and goals.\nTamarind was founded in the absence of an American print shop dedicated to serving artists, and during a period when American artists tended to reject lithography and collaborative printing in favor of the more \"direct...immediate\" possibilities of abstract expressionist painting.\nFaced with a paucity of opportunities on all fronts and a medium which seemed on the verge of extinction, Wayne sought to create more than just a studio:\nTamarind Institute's website lists the following goals, developed by founding director June Wayne with associate director Clinton Adams and technical director Garo Antreasian in 1960:\nImpact.\nTamarind can be credited with single-handedly reviving the medium of lithography in the US, both insofar as they made the medium \"respectable\" and viable and also in that their dedicated research led to technical and economic breakthroughs with a visible impact on lithography in particular and printmaking in general; e.g., lightfast inks, durable and consistent printmaking paper, precise registration systems, aluminum plate printing, and lightweight, large diameter rollers are but a few important aspects of printmaking which either originated at or were refined by Tamarind. The workshop also established several now-customary procedures for editioned prints, such as precisely recording and documenting every edition, and affixing both a workshop chop and a printer's chop to each proof or impression in recognition of the printer's important role.\nArtists.\nBelow is a partial list of some of the many artists who have created editions at Tamarind:\nMaster printers.\nOne of the principal goals of the Tamarind Institute is the training of printers. Over the years, the training of these professionals has evolved since its creation in 1960. What began as an eight-week basic training course eventually developed into a two-year program. There are five levels in the program: student printer, candidate printer, assistant printer, senior printer, and master printer. There have been over 100 Master Program certificates awarded by the Tamarind Institute.\nThe first master printer graduate from Tamarind was Irwin Hollander of Hollander's Workshop in New York City. Judith Solodkin was the first woman to complete the program. Joe Funk was the first Tamarind fellow, serving between 1960 and 1961. From 1972 to 1973, Chen Lok Lee received a fellowship from the Ford Foundation, funded in part by the National Endowment for the Arts, to study at Tamarind. Lee went on to found Mantegna Press II, with Richard Callner, in Philadelphia, PA."}

In 1933, the Nazi regime broke up clubs with links to worker's groups as politically unpalatable and the membership of \"Fu\u00dfballclub Union Alfeld\" also became part of \"Tuspo\". \"Union\" was itself the product of an earlier merger on 20 May 1915 between \"FC Hertha 1911 Alfeld\" and \"FC 1912 Alfeld\".\nFollowing the war \"SV\" spent the 1947\u201348 season in the Landesliga Niedersachsen/Hildesheim (III) finishing 9th before settling into lower level competition until the late 1950s.

The organizations that chose the teams included Walter Camp for \"Collier's Weekly\", Caspar Whitney for \"Outing Magazine\", the \"New York World\", the \"New York Sun\", \"The New York Times\", the \"New York Mail\", and Charles Chadwick.\nOverview.\nThe 1906 college football season was a year of change. Following controversies in 1905 over the increase of violence and professionalism in college football, a number of rule changes were implemented in 1906. The most lasting change introduced in 1906 was the forward pass. Several of the players selected as All-Americans in 1906 gained attention for their use of the new tactic. These include Eddie Dillon, the first Princeton quarterback to make use of the forward pass, and Yale's Paul Veeder and Bob Forbes who combined for one of the first important pass plays, a play described in one history of the game as follows: \"The only other significant pass that season was thrown by Yale, which gained a first down that led to victory over Harvard, when Paul Veeder threw thirty yards to Bob Forbes.\"\nThe Eastern powers dominated the game of college football in 1906, and players from the Ivy League dominated the All-American selections. Both the Princeton Tigers and the Yale Bulldogs finished with undefeated seasons and played each other to a 0\u20130 tie on November 17, 1906. Out of 15 players recognized in the NCAA Record Book as consensus All-Americans for the 1906 season, 13 played for Ivy League teams, and 7 played for Princeton or Yale. Only two players from \"western\" schools were first-team selections\u2014quarterback Walter Eckersall from the University of Chicago and center William Thomas Dunn from Penn State.\nThe only unanimous first-team All-American in 1906 was Yale end Bob Forbes. Other players who were named to the first team by at least five of the eight selectors reflected below were end Caspar Wister of Princeton (6 first-team designations), tackle Lucius Horatio Biglow of Yale (7 selections), guard Francis Burr of Harvard (7 selections), guard Elmer Thompson of Cornell (5 selections), center Clarence Hockenberger of Yale (5 selections), and halfback Hugh Knox of Yale (5 selections).\nThe \"Washington Post\" in December 1906 wrote of the difficulty involved in selecting eleven players for an All-American team:\"A big problem confronts the person who this year undertakes to select eleven men for a football team which he wishes to call the best in the country. There are more good men than ever before, among the minor elevens, because, with a premium, placed on speed rather than on weight, the lighter men have had a better opportunity to distinguish themselves. It would be possible to pick at least three teams which would make things mighty interesting for each other. The East has completely eclipsed the West this season, and that somewhat simplifies matters. The Western teams failed to grasp the possibilities of the new rules and players of that section who were brilliant last year did not get an opportunity, to shine this year in the new game. Walter Eckersall, of Chicago, appears to be the only Westerner who has a right to be in the All-American team this fall.\"\nIn announcing his All-American team, Caspar Whitney wrote that he had weighed character as a factor in his selections:\"This eleven is chosen, after a season's observation, with a view to collecting the most resourceful, strongest all-round team under the new rules. No man whose amateur status is a matter of question or whose play has been unsportsmanly is eligible to this national team, which, in keeping with its honorary nature, I endeavor to confine to sportsmen.\"\nAll-American selections for 1906.\nKey.\nNCAA recognized selectors for 1906\nOther selectors\nBold = Consensus All-American"}

An 1879 graduate of West Point, he served in numerous campaigns on the Western Frontier and later in the Philippines. He retired as a brigadier general in 1918.\nEducation and military career.\nCruse was born in Owensboro, Kentucky on December 29, 1857. Before attending West Point, he attended Centre College in Kentucky from 1874 to 1875. He then began attendance at the United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1879. Cruse was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 6th United States Cavalry upon graduation. Cruse was an honor graduate of the Infantry and Cavalry School in 1891. On July 12, 1892, he received the Medal of Honor \"for distinguished gallantry in action with hostile Indians\" at Big Dry Fork, Arizona on July 17, 1882. Three others also received the Medal of Honor for this action: Frank West, George H. Morgan, and Charles Taylor.\nCruse later served in the Philippine\u2013American War. He graduated from the Army War College in April 1916 and was promoted to brigadier general in December 1916. He retired from active duty in January 1918, nine months after the American entry into World War I.\nFraud allegations.\nShortly after his retirement, Cruse was accused of involvement in a scandal involving acquisition procedures which involved his employment with Chicago manufacturing agent Henry H. Lippert. Lippert and his son Ralph were arrested; they argued that they had not committed fraud, and that Cruse had not been employed by them until after his retirement from the military. All three argued that Cruse had obtained an opinion from the Army's Judge Advocate General, Enoch Crowder, which indicated that becoming an agent of the Lippert company did not violate the law. The case against Ralph Lippert was not pursued because he was drafted into the military. In April 1918, Cruse followed the advice of Henry Pinckney McCain, the Inspector General of the Army, to return to the Lipperts the money they had paid him (about $1,000), which ended his involvement in the matter. The case was resolved when authorities in Chicago reviewed the evidence against the Lipperts and declined to prosecute.\nMedal of Honor citation.\nRank and organization: Second Lieutenant, 6th U.S. Cavalry. Place and date: At Big Dry Fork, Ariz., July 17, 1882. Entered service at: Owensboro, Ky. Birth: Owensboro, Ky. Date of issue: July 12, 1892.\nGallantly charged hostile Indians, and with his carbine compelled a party of them to keep under cover of their breastworks, thus being enabled to recover a severely wounded soldier.\nPersonal life.\nCruse retired to Longport, New Jersey, where he wrote \"Apache Days and After\". He died on June 8, 1943, and was buried in Section 3, Lot 1763, of Arlington National Cemetery.\nHe married Ms. Beatrice Cottrell (1862\u20131936), who is buried with him. They had two sons, Fred Taylor Cruse and United States Naval Academy Midshipman James Thomas Cruse. James was killed in an explosion aboard the in 1907. He is buried next to his parents.\nFred T.

There is no universal consensus among Mormon scholars regarding the placement of these locations in the known world, other than somewhere in the Americas. A popular \"traditional\" view among many Latter Day Saint faithful covers much of North and South America; while many Book of Mormon scholars, particularly in recent decades, believe the text itself favors a limited Mesoamerican or other limited setting for most of the Book of Mormon events.\nThe largest of the churches embracing the Book of Mormon\u2014the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)\u2014has not endorsed an official position for the geographical setting the Book of Mormon, although some of its leaders have spoken of various possible locations over the years. There have also been multiple attempts to identify the several civilizations in the Book of Mormon, which are dated in the text as living from 2500 BC to 400 AD, but no consensus has ever been reached.\nAccording to Joseph Smith, an angel named Moroni told him \"there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang.\" According to Joseph Smith, Moroni explained that the coming forth of the Book of Mormon was to be concurrent with the fulfillment of ancient prophecies regarding the latter-day church of Christ. According to Latter Day Saint scripture, the narrative in the Book of Mormon came to an end in the ancient land Cumorah, where Moroni, in 421 AD deposited the golden plates prior to his death. Mormon and Moroni's Cumorah is claimed by many believers to be the same land containing the modern \"Hill Cumorah\" near Joseph Smith's home in Palmyra, western New York, from whence the gold plates of the Book of Mormon were retrieved. Others view the modern \"Hill Cumorah\" to be distinct from the original, and simply to have been named after it; thus adding no information to the question of the location of the lands described in the Book of Mormon.\nInternal map.\nInternal Book of Mormon geography focuses on the relationships between lands and other geographic features, independent of where they might be physically located on today's maps. The purpose of constructing unbiased internal maps is to orient major lands, seas and landmarks mentioned in the text, and estimate relative distances between them; without trying to 'fit them' into any proposed setting on a modern map. A careful investigation of the Book of Mormon's internal geography is useful to guard against bias by researchers using favored \"known-world\" settings and/or traditions.\nThe following is a brief overview of the Book of Mormon's New World (American) internal geography. Three groups are known to have migrated: Jaredites, Lehites and Mulekites:\nAfter arriving in the New World, Nephi, a son of Lehi, left the place of their first landing and traveled with his followers \"many days\" in the wilderness. \"Many\" is a non-specific word that can mean anything from \"three hours\" to \"forty days.\" This particular journey did not take Nephi and his followers beyond the territory that would later be called the land of Nephi. Numerous other travel times are mentioned within the Book of Mormon, generally just days or less. Thus the text of the Book of Mormon is often viewed by scholars as favoring a 'limited' setting of just a few hundred miles for most of its events. For example, a group ostensibly consisting of the very young and old with \"their flocks\" and some belongings, could travel from the land of Nephi \"down\" through a \"strip\" of wilderness to the land of Zarahemla in less than 21 days.\nNumerous other details in the Book of Mormon indicate principal lands that are quite localized, generally negating the possibility that the Book of Mormon settings cover major parts of both North and South America.\nJoseph Smith's statements regarding Book of Mormon geography.\nPublished articles in the \"Times &amp; Seasons\" newspaper (of which Joseph Smith was the editor) indicate that Book of Mormon peoples, or their descendants, migrated from \"the lake country of America\" to Mexico and Central America. In 1841 Joseph Smith read Stephens' \"Incidents of Travel in Central America\". Smith held Stephens' work in high regard and recommended it. However, Stephens' bestseller did not change Smith's position that Book of Mormon events took place in northern America, in lands primarily occupied by the United States.\nIn the Wentworth Letter Joseph Smith wrote the following regarding his interview with the angel Moroni:I was also informed concerning the aboriginal inhabitants of this country'\", and shown who they were, and from whence they came; a brief sketch of their origin, progress, civilization, laws, governments, of their righteousness and iniquity, and the blessings of God being finally withdrawn from them as a people was made known unto me: I was also told where there was deposited some plates on which were engraven an abridgment of the records of the ancient prophets that had existed on \"\"this continent\" ...In his \"AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES\" editorial of July 1842, the \"Times &amp; Seasons\" newspaper corroborates wars described in the Book of Mormon with archaeological finds in northern America. It is not certain as to which articles in the \"Times &amp; Seasons\" signed \"\"-\"ED\" were authored by Joseph Smith, approved by Joseph Smith, or otherwise handled by editorial assistants since Joseph Smith was frequently absent and only the nominal editor.\nThe \"Times &amp; Seasons\" quotes Josiah Priest's \"American Antiquities\" statement that \"Weapons of brass have been found in many parts of America, as in the Canadas, Florida, &amp;c., with curiously sculptured stones, all of which go to prove that this country was once peopled with civilized, industrious nations ...\"\nThe \"Times &amp; Seasons\" associates earth, timber and metal works found in northern America (presumably artifacts of mound builder societies) with implements and constructions described in the Book of Mormon. As much as Joseph Smith approved of Stephens' work, the \"Times &amp; Seasons\" only makes minor mention of it, and then only to conclude in the \"American Antiquities\" editorial, that the peoples of Central America are tied historically to the Book of Mormon. Regarding the peoples of Central America, the \"Times &amp; Seasons\" concludes:\nStephens and Catherwood's researches in Central America abundantly testify of this thing. The stupendous ruins, the elegant sculpture, and the magnificence of the ruins of Guatemala, and other cities, corroborate this statement, and show that a great and mighty people-men of great minds, clear intellect, bright genius, and comprehensive designs inhabited this continent. Their ruins speak of their greatness; the Book of Mormen [Mormon] unfolds their history.-ED.\nThe article does not actually say that Book of Mormon lands are to be found in Central America. This assertion came later in several unsigned newspaper articles, published in the Fall of 1842. The use of first person plural (\"we\" and \"us\") indicates that the articles may have been a collaborative effort. A recent \"word-print\" stylometry study of the unsigned articles concluded that they contain Joseph Smith's vocabulary and average sentence lengths. One LDS apologist, however, argues that the statistical word-print analysis cannot identify everything that was edited in the articles and by whom. Without an endorsing signature we cannot tell the extent to which Joseph Smith agreed with the opinions expressed in the unsigned articles.\nIn the March 15, 1842 edition of the \"Times and Seasons\", Joseph Smith informed readers that he would endorse his articles with his signature. W. Vincent Coon argues that the unsigned 1842 articles contradict each other. One of the articles in question mentions \"Joseph Smith\" in the third person. This same article alleges that Lehi \"landed a little south of the Isthmus of Darien\" which would place Lehi's landing on a western shore of South America. The 1842 \"Times and Seasons\" editorials, written by Joseph Smith, are readily identified as they end with his \"ED\".\nJoseph Smith had found it necessary to go into hiding for much of the Fall that year. Though he was still official editor of the \"Times and Seasons\", it is doubtful that he was acting editor at the time inasmuch as he was keeping a low public profile and had been in hiding, as Doctrine and Covenants 127:1 and 128:1 attest. LDS Church History Scholars believe that John Taylor may have served as \"the acting editor for the \"Times and Seasons\"\" in Joseph's absence. In November 1842, Joseph Smith officially resigned as editor, explaining that, \"The multiplicity of other business that daily devolves upon me, renders it impossible for me to do justice to a paper so widely circulated as the Times and Seasons.\" John Taylor was then made official editor of the newspaper.\nPublished in the same issue as the unsigned \"ZARAHEMLA\" article (October 1842) with its anachronistic claims about the ruins of Quirigua, is a signed epistle to the church from the Mormon prophet in hiding. In Joseph Smith's letter (canonized as the 128th section of the LDS Doctrine and Covenants) the Book of Mormon land Cumorah is referenced among other locations of significance near the Finger Lakes.\nSeveral earlier statements by Joseph Smith, indicate that events described in the Book of Mormon took place in lands occupied by the United States of America. In an 1833 letter to N.C. Saxton, he wrote:\nThe Book of Mormon is a record of the forefathers of our western tribes of Indians \u2026 . By it we learn that our western tribes of Indians are descendants from that Joseph that was sold into Egypt, and that the land [of] America is a promised land unto them, and unto it, all the tribes of Israel will come, with as many of the Gentiles as shall comply with the requisitions of the new covenant. But the tribe of Judah will return to old Jerusalem.\nThe expression, \"our western tribes of Indians\" refers to Indian tribes who lived west, or were pushed west from the east coast of the United States by European expansion. LDS missionaries were sent to these peoples in the early days of the Church. Latter-day scripture refers to these peoples as \"Lamanites\". Several passages in LDS scripture associate these native peoples with peoples of the Book of Mormon. LDS scripture teaches that the land of their Book of Mormon ancestors (presumably the territories now occupied by the United States of America) was ordained to become a land \"free unto all ...\". The ancient land of their inheritance is, according to LDS scripture, associated with the land of \"New Jerusalem.\". New Jerusalem, \"the city of Zion\" is, according to LDS scripture to be built in northern America.\nSome scholars argue that Joseph Smith came to believe that the Maya ruins on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula discovered in the late 1830s, offered evidence in support of the Book of Mormon's authenticity. A more recent inclusion in \"History of the Church\" proclaims the ruins were likely Nephite or belonging to \"the ancient inhabitants of America treated of in the Book of Mormon\". In view of the position that ancient peoples migrated from the north into Mexico and Central America, the linking of Mesoamerican artifacts with \"ancient inhabitants ... of ... the Book of Mormon\" is not inconsistent with Joseph Smith's statements placing Book of Mormon lands in northern America. The \"History of the Church\" statement was inserted under the date June 25, 1842 and is not taken from any holograph writing of Joseph Smith or records kept by his clerks. The date, in fact, is only a few weeks prior to the publication of the AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES editorial, citing northern American evidence of Book of Mormon history. The inclusion in \"History of the Church\" reads as follows:\nMessrs. Stephens and Catherwood have succeeded in collecting in the interior of America a large amount of relics of the Nephites, or the ancient inhabitants of America treated of in the Book of Mormon, which relics have recently been landed in New York.\nStephens brought to New York hundreds of artifacts from Mayan sites, including sculptures and architectural remnants. Shortly after arriving in New York, most of these relics were lost when the building that housed them was destroyed by fire.\nAccording to , Nephite civilization came to an end near the year 384 A.D., with only a few Nephites surviving,() of which some or all were \"hunted until they were destroyed\" by the surviving tribal civilization. The Copan and Quirigua, sites in the Yucatan visited by Stephens and Catherwood, contain artifacts that date more recent than Book of Mormon times. It has not been shown that any of Stephens' artifacts date to Book of Mormon times, and Joseph Smith does not make this assertion.\nThe first history of the Church was written in 1834 and 1835 by Oliver Cowdery, as a series of articles published serially in the Church's Messenger and Advocate. In this history, Cowdery stated that the final battle between the Nephites and the Lamanites occurred at the \"Hill Cumorah,\" the very same Hill Cumorah in New York, where Joseph Smith said he obtained golden plates and other artifacts which were used to translate the Book of Mormon. These plates and artifacts were shown to only a few witnesses and never to the general public. The plates were later claimed to have been returned to the angel, Moroni. Oliver Cowdery also identified the Jaredites' final battle as occurring in the same area as the Nephite/Lamanite final battle. Since Smith was an editor of the \"Messenger and Advocate\" and approved the history, all but proponents of limited South American and Mesoamerican geography theories believe it conclusively demonstrated Joseph Smith's belief as well. In any case, evidence appears to show that Smith did not subscribe to the limited Mesoamerican or South American geography theories promoted by some LDS today. Joseph Smith clearly advocated a northern American setting (near the Finger Lakes) for the Book of Mormon land Cumorah, hence .\nLucy Mack Smith, Joseph Smith's mother, in her account of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, says that the divine messenger called the hill where the plates were deposited the \"hill of Cumorah\" meaning \"hill of\" the Book of Mormon land \"Cumorah\". In another account, she said that young Joseph referred to the hill using this description.\nJoseph Smith's preeminence as an authority on the Book of Mormon is evinced by the following account given by his mother:\nDuring our evening conversations, Joseph, would occasionally give us some of the most amusing recitals that could be imagined. He would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent, their dress, mode of traveling, and the animals upon which they rode; their cities and buildings, with every particular; their mode of warfare; and also their religious worship. This he would do with as much ease, seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life among them.\nEfforts to associate Joseph Smith with the geographic notions of his contemporaries remain speculative. A note in the handwriting of Frederick G. Williams, a scribe and counselor to Smith, asserts that Lehi's people landed in South America at thirty degrees south latitude. Early LDS church leader, Orson Pratt also speculated that the Nephite landing site was on the coast of Chile near Valparaiso, but Pratt indicated that this hypothesis was arrived at by supposition, not divine revelation. There is no proof that Williams' unsigned, undated writing represents a revelation given to Joseph Smith. In 1938 an article in the Church magazine \"The Instructor\" discouraged Church members from making too much of the Williams document.\nHemispheric models.\nEvidence indicates that early members of the Church did not pay a great deal of attention to Book of Mormon details about distances. The \"Hemispheric\" or \"Two-Continent\" model proposes that Book of Mormon lands stretch many thousands of miles over much of South and North America. There is no first hand, verifiable statement by Joseph Smith endorsing this view. One of the earliest advocates of a hemispheric setting was the young missionary Orson Pratt, who as early as 1832 publicly promoted the idea that Lehi \"crossed the water into South America\". For some who read the Book of Mormon, with maps of the Western Hemisphere in view, the Isthmus of Panama seems an easy fit for the Book of Mormon's \"narrow neck of land\". Pratt claimed that the \"running battle\", culminating in the destruction of the Nephite nation, started at \"the Isthmus of Darien\" (Panama) and \"ended at Manchester\" (western New York). Pratt never attributed his geography (or one like it) to Joseph Smith. Pratt in fact, indicated that the South American landing idea was supposition, not revelation. Pratt's geographic views were published in the 1879 edition of the Book of Mormon, but retracted from later editions.\nThere was no consensus of opinion among early Mormon leaders on the topic of Book of Mormon geography. The hemispheric setting of Apostle Parley P. Pratt, for instance, differed from that of his brother Orson. Strongly influenced by John Lloyd Stephens' 1841 bestseller, \"Incidents of Travel in Central America\", Parley Pratt set various Book of Mormon lands (including, apparently, the narrow neck) farther north and west of Panama. As early as 1842, Apostle John E. Page published a more limited, non-hemispheric setting for the Book of Mormon. Page originally placed the narrow neck at the Bay of Honduras; and by 1848 appears to have relocated the narrow neck more to the northwest. Other LDS, in 1842, figured all of Central America to be the narrow neck. Prior to the influence of John Lloyd Stephens' popular book, some church members placed the southernmost Nephite land of Manti well within the boundaries of United States territory.\nIn the 1850s the following unsigned statement was circulated among Latter-day Saints:\nThe course that Lehi traveled from the city of Jerusalem to the place where he and his family took ship, they traveled nearly a south, southeast direction until they came to the nineteenth degree of North Latitude, then, nearly east to the Sea of Arabia then sailed in a southeast direction and landed on the continent of South America in Chili [Chile] thirty degrees south latitude.\nThe original is in the handwriting of early church leader Frederick G. Williams, who held a definite opinion on the subject of Book of Mormon geography. The statement was partially rewritten by church authorities Richards and Little and published as a \"Revelation to Joseph the Seer\" - a statement which the original did not contain. The Chilean landing site, promoted in the Williams document, matches Orson Pratt's geography. Prominent LDS would later call into question the statement's authority; but before this would happen, church leaders publicly attributed (without verification or proof) features of Orson Pratt's geography to Joseph Smith. The idea that Lehi landed on the coast of temperate Chile, thousand of miles south of Panama's narrow neck, and that tropical Colombia's thousand mile long Magdalena River is the River Sidon, were presented by church scholars as mainstream, majority views in the LDS community.\nCentral America models.\nIt has been claimed in recent years, that within the Mormon community, more scholars have gravitated toward this general group of geographic scenarios than any other group of theories. While there are disagreements about where the \"narrow neck of land\" resides, e.g. southern Mexico, Honduras, the Isthmus of Rivas between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, Panama, the following list of theories can all be categorized as Central American based.\nEarly LDS became engrossed with John Lloyd Stephens' 1841 bestseller, \"Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan\". Despite Stephens' own published conclusion that the marvelous stone ruins which he and Frederick Catherwood documented were not of \"great antiquity\", some LDS nevertheless, placed much importance on matching these stone ruins to Book of Mormon cities. For some, this endeavor had higher priority than looking for the narrowest and correctly oriented Mesoamerican isthmus. In time, more Mormon scholars came to realize that the New World Book of Mormon lands were quite localized.\nThe earliest, most limited Central American models were posited by members of the RLDS Church. In one detail, none of these proposed settings are exactly limited geographically: they all require Moroni to have transported the plates and other articles thousands of miles to western New York.\nLDS apologist Vincent Coon cites non-LDS archaeologist Salvatore Trento, who posits the possibility that Joseph Smith actually discovered buried metal tablets engraved with \"weird markings\". Trento notes comparable discoveries in Northeastern America which Coon points out are not likely the result of a singular ancient individual traveling thousands of miles from Central or South America. Such finds are consistent with the 19th century \"Mound Builder\" literary setting in which the Book of Mormon is classed by mainstream American History and Literature specialists.\nHeartland models.\nThe \"Heartland\" Model or \"Heartland Theory\" of Book of Mormon geography states that the Book of Mormon events primarily occurred in the heartland of North America. The Hill Cumorah in Ontario County NY is the hill where Joseph Smith found the Golden Plates and is the same hill where the civilizations of the Nephites (Cumorah) and the Jaredites (Ramah) fought their last battles. Oliver Cowdery with the assistance of Joseph Smith wrote \"... Here, between these hills, the entire power and national strength of both the Jaredites and Nephites were destroyed. By turning to the 529th and 530th pages of the Book of Mormon, you will read Mormon's account of the last great struggle of his people, as they were encamped round this hill Cumorah.\u00a0 In this valley fell the remaining strength and pride of a once powerful people, the Nephites\u2014once so highly favored of the Lord, but at that time in darkness, doomed to suffer extermination by the hand of their barbarous and uncivilized brethren. From the top of this hill, Mormon, with a few others, after the battle, gazed with horror upon the mangled remains of those who, the day before, were filled with anxiety, hope, or doubt.\"\nAmong its proposals are that Mound Builders, including the Hopewell and the Adena, were among those peoples described in accounts of events in Book of Mormon books such as Alma and Helaman. The ancient city of Zarahemla is believed to be near Montrose, Iowa. (D&amp;C 125:3). The Mississippi River is identified as the River Sidon, and the Springs of Northern Georgia just south of Chattanooga, Tennessee are identified as possibly being the Waters of Mormon. The Niagara Falls Peninsula has been described as the \"narrow neck of land\" mentioned in the Book of Ether. In addition, the Appalachian region of Tennessee is most likely to be the Land of Nephi. It is also proposed that Lehi's journey sailed west after going around Africa which would be a much shorter voyage than across the Indian and Pacific Oceans (as demonstrated by the path of the modern-day \"Phoenician\" ship's experimental circumnavigation voyage around Africa in 2010 by Philip Beale followed by an Atlantic crossing in 2019-2020). They propose that Lehi and his family landed somewhere near Florida, that the land of Nephi was in Tennessee and that the Mulokites and Jaredites settled the land after traveling along the great lakes river system into Ohio valley and then the proposed Zarahemla site near Montrose, Iowa.\nIn recent years, this theory, which challenges the traditional paradigm of Central America as a primary location for Book of Mormon geography, has become a \"movement\" among many active members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Proponents see this new model as a way of better supporting the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon.\nIn the Joseph Smith Papers, Joseph Smith had a vision that was written down by Wilford Woodruff, Heber C. Kimball, George A. Smith and many others. \"On the top of the mound were stones which presented the appearance of three altars having been erected one above the other, according to the ancient order; and the remains of bones were strewn over the surface of the ground. The brethren procured a shovel and a hoe, and removing the earth to the depth of about one foot, discovered the skeleton of a man, almost entire, and between his ribs the stone point of a Lamanitish arrow, which evidently produced his death. Elder Burr Riggs retained the arrow. The contemplation of the scenery around us produced peculiar sensations in our bosoms; and subsequently the visions of the past being opened to my understanding by the Spirit of the Almighty, I discovered that the person whose skeleton was before us was a white Lamanite, a large, thick-set man, and a man of God. His name was Zelph. He was a warrior and chieftain under the great prophet Onandagus, who was known from the Hill Cumorah, or eastern sea to the Rocky mountains. The curse was taken from Zelph, or, at least, in part-one of his thigh bones was broken by a stone flung from a sling, while in battle, years before his death. He was killed in battle by the arrow found among his ribs, during the last great struggle of the Lamanites and Nephites.\"\nA few days after the open vision, the Prophet Joseph Smith in a letter to his wife Emma on June 4, 1834 near Atlas, Illinois on the Mississippi River said the following: \"The whole of our journey, in the midst of so large a company of social honest and sincere men, wandering over the plains of the Nephites, recounting occasionally the history of the Book of Mormon, roving over the mounds of that once beloved people of the Lord, picking up their skulls &amp; their bones, as a proof of its divine authenticity ... During our travels we visited several of the mounds which had been thrown up by the ancient inhabitants of this country-Nephites, Lamanites, etc.\nGreat Lakes theories.\nProponents of the Great Lakes theory adhere to the teachings of LDS Church leaders, official church history, and church canon that identify the hill in Palmyra, New York as the Hill Cumorah of the Book of Mormon, the place of the final Nephite battle. Great Lakes theories differ in that they incorporate the land of Palmyra, New York as the place of the final Nephite battle and the place where the Jaredite Omer walked.\nSouth America models.\nAn unsigned document in the handwriting of early church leader Frederick G. Williams alleges that Lehi landed 30 degrees South of the equator, in what would be modern day Chile. There are several theories that try to confirm this. Many people who support this group of theories believe that part of South America was under water, and that the continent rose up during the major earthquakes mentioned in the Book of Mormon during Christ's crucifixion in the Old World."}

A Broadway transfer opened in April 2012. It toured the UK in 2013, after the London production closed in October 2012.\nThe plot centres on lovers Sam and Molly, who are attacked as they are returning to their apartment. When Sam dies he becomes caught between the real world and the next. Molly is in danger and Sam cannot leave her. A medium, Oda Mae Brown, helps Sam to get in touch with Molly to warn her.\nPlot.\nAct I.\nThe musical starts when Sam Wheat and his long-time girlfriend, Molly Jensen, move into a loft apartment in Brooklyn together (\"Here Right Now\"). Sam is a banker, Molly a sculptor, and their friend Carl Bruner is introduced as one of Sam's co-workers, come to help them settle in. The three of them seem to be a tight-knit group, with Sam and Molly very much in love. However, Sam clearly shies away from the word \"love\", which makes Molly visibly uncomfortable. She starts to say something about it, but soon stops herself, and Sam distracts her with a rendition of \"Unchained Melody,\" leaving her insecurities temporarily forgotten.\nAt work, Sam notices some discrepancies with several accounts and is unwilling to let them go, despite the fact that he has a date with Molly that evening (\"More\"). He confides in Carl with his discovery, and his friend not only agrees to keep the findings a secret, but promises to investigate himself, so Sam can keep his date. Thanking him, Sam leaves, and meets up with Molly, who later confesses that she wants to marry him. Sam is taken aback and Molly suddenly asks why he never tells her that he loves her (\"Three Little Words\"); he assures Molly that he doesn't say it in so many words because he prefers to say it through his actions. Molly tells him that she'd still like to hear it every now and again, but his reply reassures her nonetheless. However, they're soon approached by an armed man that tries to steal Sam's wallet. Sam fights back instead of surrendering, and the two struggle for the gun. It goes off and Sam is fatally shot, leaving Molly to cry out for help. Instead of moving on, however, Sam becomes a ghost, and he stays behind with Molly instead of following the light; unable to leave Molly, he follows her to the hospital, and another ghost explains what he's become (\"Ball of Wax\"). A trapped Sam struggles to reach out to Molly (\"I Can't Breathe\").\nBack at the apartment, Carl helps Molly clear out some of Sam's old things; clearly, she's hesitant to let go, totally unbeknownst to the fact that Sam is very close by, unable to move on himself. When she's alone, the man that killed Sam sneaks in and begins to ransack the place while Molly is upstairs, forcing Sam into a panic that he'll hurt her, too. Sam manages to spook the man and he flees. Needing to know who he is, Sam pushes himself through the front door with great effort, and follows the man all the way back to his own apartment. He finds out that the man's name is Willie Lopez, and that he'd eventually go back for what he was looking for. Desperate, Sam then seeks out a psychic, Oda Mae Brown, who seems to be a total fraud (\"Are You a Believer?\"). By some miracle, she actually hears Sam, and he convinces her to go talk to Molly on his behalf - by singing '10,000 Bottles of Beer on the Wall' obnoxiously, no less. In the meantime, Molly is grieving and not taking the loss very well (\"With You\"). She gets a visit from Oda Mae, but Molly is hesitant to believe, until Oda Mae starts parroting things that only Sam would know. Eventually, she comes around, and agrees to listen. Through Oda Mae, Sam tells her that he was set up, murdered, and that she needs to go to the police; Oda Mae bails as soon as she hears the word. Molly takes this information to Carl, who tells her that it's crazy, but promises to check it out. She goes to the police and Carl goes straight to Willie's place where a distraught Sam discovers the truth, in that his murder to hide Carl's financial misdeeds. As Molly swears to suspend all disbelief, a drunken Carl wanders the streets trying to convince himself it was not his fault (\"Suspend My Disbelief/I Had a Life\").\nAct II.\nAt the police station, it's revealed that Oda Mae has quite the criminal record. Shaken, Molly leaves there with the knowledge that the psychic is a fraud and she loses hope, much to Sam's dismay (\"Rain/Hold On\"). Molly in her anger sits down to do some pottery as the radio plays. Static is heard and Molly gets up to change to station, as she turns the dial \"Unchained Melody\" is suddenly heard. Molly quickly turns off the radio in shock. After a moments pause she turns it back on and slowly returns to her pottery. Sam, who is watching, approaches her from behind singing along, longing for her touch. Just as Molly begins frustrated and starts to lean back as if she can feel Sam, there is a knock on the door. It's Carl. Molly tells Carl that he was right, that the whole thing was crazy, and that she was just grasping at straws. He assures her that it's only natural, but she has to move on, and he even makes a poorly received move on her (\"Life Turns on a Dime\"). Enraged, Sam manages to break something, and a flustered Molly asks Carl to leave.\nWith the help of another ghost on the subway, Sam learns how to move objects (\"Focus\") and returns to Oda Mae's place to enlist her help once more (\"Talkin' Bout a Miracle\"). Suddenly, Oda Mae is a legitimate psychic, with the ability to call on other spirits instead of resorting to fraud. While Sam is there, Willie Lopez finds her, and she has to run for her life. Sam uses his newfound abilities to spook him and chase him away, but Willie runs into traffic and dies. Unlike Sam, he is not offered a white light, but it's implied that he's dragged somewhere completely different. However, Sam knows that it isn't over, and he begs Oda Mae to help him stop Carl from getting to the money, in order to protect Molly.\nWe then see Molly, trying to get her life together and move on (\"Nothing Stops Another Day\"); it's seen that she's selling pieces at her gallery and she apologizes to Carl for pushing him away. Carl, meanwhile, is anxiously awaiting a call and waves her off under the guise of having a busy day. Together, Sam and Oda Mae break into the account that Carl was extorting, Sam feeding her account numbers and information while she poses as 'Rita Miller.' The account is closed and Sam goes to find Carl in his office, in a panic. Moving objects around the room, Sam scares Carl, moving objects around again and making it clear that he knows what really happened. Scared, Carl tells Sam that he'll kill Molly if he doesn't leave him alone and get him the money. However, Sam runs back to Oda Mae.\nWhen she's handed a check for around four million dollars, Oda Mae tries to take the money and leave the situation for good (\"I'm Outta Here\"), but Sam convinces her to donate the money. Sam then takes her to go see Molly again in order to warn her about Carl. At the apartment, Molly tries to send her away at first, but Sam is able to walk through the door and tell Oda Mae the significance of the earrings Molly is wearing, as well as read a letter for Sam that Molly has inside the apartment. After Oda Mae repeats these things, Molly is able to believe again, and she lets the psychic in. She explains everything to Molly, who is clearly emotionally distraught, and Oda Mae even lets Sam use her body to hold Molly and comfort her (\"Unchained Melody (Dance)\")\nCarl comes into the apartment, armed and frightened for his own life; he owes dangerous drug dealers money and he's desperate. Even though it's clear that he doesn't want to resort to such measures, Carl grabs Molly and holds his gun to her, telling Sam that if he doesn't have Oda Mae tell him where the money is, he's going to kill her. There's a struggle, and Carl is killed, and he's dragged away in the same way as Willie.\nNow that Carl is gone and Molly is safe, the light returns for Sam and Molly is able to see and hear him. Knowing that it's time for him to go, Sam says goodbye to Oda Mae, and regretfully turns to Molly. They're able to say their goodbyes, Sam finally telling Molly that he loves her in the way that she wants to hear (\"Finale\").\nProductions.\nManchester (2011).\nThe musical had a world premiere try-out at the Manchester Opera House, Manchester, England with performances beginning 28 March 2011 and running through 14 May 2011.

Without eye-popping tricks, the show offers zip in the way of wonder... [the] book... clunks along. The love story gets swamped by numerous scenes and robotic dance numbers about New York\u2019s frantic fast-paced corporate jungle. Some moments seem to exist simply for visuals \u2014 Hey, let\u2019s use umbrellas!\"\nIn a more positive vein, the \"talkinbroadway.com\" reviewer wrote \"Librettist-lyricist Bruce Joel Rubin ... and composer-lyricists Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard have written one of the finest film-to-stage adaptations in current memory, which Matthew Warchus has directed with energy and passion. Add in a better-than-necessary cast led by U.K. actor Richard Fleeshman and Caissie Levy ... both of whom originated their roles in London, and you have an evening that startles with just how good it is. In relative terms, at any rate. I'm not willing to go as far as saying that this is a great musical, or even an objectively good one... But it positively glows by the standards of all this Broadway season's new offerings and the likes of most other recent movie-inspired outings.\""}

Under the direction of head coach Steve Fisher, the team finished second in the Big Ten Conference. Although the team compiled a 31\u20135 record during the season, the National Collegiate Athletic Association has adjusted the team's record to 0-4 due to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. The team earned an invitation to the 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where it was national runner up. The team was ranked for the entire eighteen weeks of Associated Press Top Twenty-Five Poll, starting the season ranked first, holding the number one position for three weeks and ending ranked third, and it ended the season ranked fourth in the final USA Today/CNN Poll. The team had an 8\u20135 record against ranked opponents, including the following victories: December 28, 1992, against #20 Nebraska 88\u201373 in the Rainbow Classic at the Blaisdell Center, December 29 against #5 North Carolina 79\u201378 in the Rainbow Classic, December 30 against #2 Kansas 86\u201374 in the Rainbow Classic, January 7, 1993, against #9 Purdue 80\u201370 at Mackey Arena, February 2 against #25 Michigan State 73\u201369 at the Breslin Student Events Center, February 7 against #19 Purdue 84\u201376 at Crisler Arena, March 2 against #15 Iowa 82\u201373 at Crisler Arena, April 2 against #2 Kentucky 81\u201378 (OT) at the Superdome in the 1993 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nThe team had rotating captains on a game-by-game basis, and Chris Webber earned team MVP. The team's leading scorers were Chris Webber (690 points), Jalen Rose (555 points), and Juwan Howard (524 points).

They defeated Coastal Carolina in their first game and then were taken to overtime by #9 seed UCLA before escaping with a victory.\nThe Wolverines moved on to the Kingdome for the regionals. The sub-regional had been littered with upsets, as the #12, #13, and #15 seeds had all won in the first round. Michigan drew #12 seeded George Washington and won, then faced Temple for the second consecutive year (having defeated them as a #6 seed the year before) and beating them 77\u201372 to join Kentucky, Kansas, and North Carolina in the Final Four in New Orleans.\nIn their national semifinal at the Superdome on April 3, the team defeated Southeast Regional winner Kentucky 81\u201378 in overtime.\nIn the championship game at the Superdome on April 5, the Wolverines lost to East Regional winner North Carolina 77\u201371. Michigan's final possession of the game went down as one of the most memorable moments in college basketball history. With twenty seconds to go and Michigan trailing by two and out of timeouts, Chris Webber rebounded a missed free throw. Confused as to what to do next, Webber thought about passing to Jalen Rose but did not and took a step without dribbling the basketball. The officials did not see the travel, however, and Webber headed upcourt where North Carolina was set up in a half court trap defense. Webber ran directly into the trap and was double teamed in the corner. He could not break the double team to pass the ball, and called for a timeout that the Wolverines did not have. By rule, Michigan was given a technical foul for calling the extra timeout and North Carolina was given two free throws and possession of the ball. North Carolina made their free throws, then added two more when Michigan was forced to foul again after the change in possession.\nThe team established numerous NCAA records for three-point field goals in the final four: fewest single-game three-point field goals made in a final four (0 vs. Kentucky on April 3, 1993, in an overtime) and fewest single-game three-point field goals attempted (4 vs. Kentucky). The 0 three-point field goals made surpassed the team's previous record of 1 made against Duke the year before in the 1992 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nLater developments.\nIn 2002, the Wolverines vacated their entire 1992\u201393 season, including their tournament appearance, in the wake of a major scandal involving many years of improper payments from a major booster to several former players, among them Webber.\nStatistics.\nThe team posted the following statistics:\nTeam players drafted into the NBA.\nFive players from this team were selected in the NBA draft."}

{"id": "22460260", "revid": "38104346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22460260", "title": "Charles Darwin (medical student)", "text": "Charles Darwin (3 September 1758 \u2013 15 May 1778) was the eldest son of Erasmus Darwin (1731\u20131802) and Mary Howard (1740\u201370), and was the uncle of the famous naturalist Charles Darwin (though dying before his nephew's birth). He showed considerable promise while studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, but died while still a student.\nChildhood and classical education.\nA memoir by his father recalled young Charles Darwin as having a precocious interest in science, from infancy being:\nLike his father, he had a stammer as a child. In an attempt to cure this by learning the French language, around the end of October 1766 the eight-year-old Charles Darwin was sent to Paris with a private tutor, the Reverend Samuel Dickenson. They travelled, and brought back many aromatic plants of Montpellier from Gouan. Darwin was only allowed to converse in French, and by their return in or possibly after March 1767 he was able to speak fluent French without a stammer, but the problem persisted when he spoke English. He went on to study at Lichfield School which had, in his father's view, an excessive emphasis on the Classics. His mother suffered from a long illness, and died on 30 July 1770. Erasmus showed deep distress, but was resilient and after about a year found another partner. Charles continued to show impressive abilities as he grew up. He made friends with some of his father's fellow members of the Lunar Society, including William Small and Matthew Boulton.\nIn September 1774 Darwin entered Christ Church, University of Oxford at the age of 16, and he matriculated there on 30 March 1775. He studied at Oxford for less than a year, as he disliked the curriculum as pursuing \"classical elegance\" and \"sigh'd to be removed to the robuster exercises of the medical schools of Edinburgh.\"\nUniversity of Edinburgh.\nDarwin arrived at the University of Edinburgh in the Autumn of 1775 or early in 1776, and was well settled in by April. At that time the university had a Europe wide reputation for its invigorating emphasis on experimental methods and intellectual stimulus. Soon after joining the university Darwin became friends with the up-and-coming clinical teacher Andrew Duncan, staying in his house and getting personal guidance as well as access to the wards of The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. He discussed his interests in letters to his father, commenting on new ideas and therapies in use. In April 1776 Erasmus wrote mentioning studies of the human pulse, and an unpublished manuscript \"What are the established varieties of the pulse, their causes &amp; uses in medicine\" appears to have been one of Charles Darwin's earliest works, showing his abilities in observations of variations due to age or exercise, and a good grasp of the current literature on blood circulation. He submitted a dissertation on the distinction between mucus and pus for the first annual gold medal of the Aesculapian Society at Edinburgh, and won this medal in March 1778. His graduating dissertation, written as a conventional thesis in classical Latin, discussed the relationship between the lymphoid system and \"dropsy\", heart failure. As well as following the teachings on this subject in Edinburgh at that time, it showed his independent ideas and evidence from well considered experiments.\nIllness and death.\nHe died on 15 May 1778, apparently from a cut sustained while performing an autopsy.About the end of April, Mr. Darwin had employed the greatest part of a day in accurately dissecting the brain of a child which had died of hydrocephalus, and which he had attended during its life. That very evening he was seized with severe head-ach. This, however, did not prevent him from being present in the Medical Society, where he mentioned to Dr. Duncan the dissection he had made, and promised the next day to furnish him with an account of all the circumstances in writing. But the next day, to his headach there supervened other febrile symptoms. And, in a short time, from the hemorrhagies, petechial eruption, and foetid loose stools which occurred, his disease manifested a very putrescent tendency.\nThe clinical picture described here, particularly the petechial haemorrhages, strongly supports a diagnosis of meningococcal disease.\nCharles Darwin was buried in the family vault of his professor and mentor, Andrew Duncan MD, in the Burying Ground of the Parish Church of St Cuthbert's chapel of ease (later renamed Buccleuch Parish Church), sited on the south side of Edinburgh at 33 Chapel Street, not far from the Old College of the University of Edinburgh.\nPublication of work.\nErasmus translated his son's graduating dissertation from Latin into English, and had it together with the gold medal winning dissertation published in Lichfield in book form in 1780 as \"Experiments establishing a criterion between mucaginous and purulent matter. And an account of the retrograde motion from the absorbent vessels of animal bodies in some diseases.\" The author's name was shown as Charles Darwin, and Erasmus wrote a short memoir as an appendix, including the description of his son's childhood shown above. It also includes the only description Erasmus published of the boy's mother, Mary Howard, praising her for having brought their son up to have \"sympathy with the pains and pleasures of others\", and \"as she had wisely sown no seeds of superstition in his mind, there was nothing to overshade the virtues she had implanted.\"\nPages 103\u2013112 describe the use of \"decoction of foxglove\" (digitalis) to treat \"dropsy\" (heart failure), under the heading \"A note belonging to \"page\" 65, \"and\" 68\", and the words \"The fox-glove has been given to dropsical patients in this country with considerable success: the following cases are related with design to ascertain the particular kinds of dropsy, in which this drug is preferable to squill, or other evacuants.\" The case notes given on these pages are the first published account of the treatment, predating the description published in 1785 by its discoverer William Withering in \"An account of the foxglove and some of its medical uses\".\nThe book of Darwin's dissertations does not mention Withering, but the first case described in its appendix is a \"Miss Hill of Aston near Newport\" who is given a more detailed description as case IV in Withering's book. Erasmus Darwin noted the date in his \"Commonplace\" book as 25 July 1776, and it appears that he learnt of the use of digitalis when both he and Withering saw this patient in consultation. Withering's description suggests he is annoyed at Darwin's incomplete account, and Page 8 of his book says that \"Dr. Duncan also tells me that the late very ingenious and accomplished Mr. Charles Darwin, informed him of its being used by his father and myself, in cases of Hydrothorax, and that he has ever since mentioned it in his lectures, and sometimes employed it in his practice.\" Though there is no indication as to the author of the case descriptions, implying that they were part of Charles Darwin's dissertation, in later publications Erasmus Darwin said he had appended case notes, and it seems clear that these were his own. In a paper, dated 14 January 1785 and read on 16 March of that year, Erasmus Darwin published a more detailed \"account of the successful use of foxglove\", but this gained little attention. Withering's \"account\" has a preface dated 1 July 1885, and its publication later that year convinced physicians of the use of digitalis as treatment. While Darwin had priority of publication, Withering is rightly given credit for finding and developing this treatment, and was understandably annoyed at Erasmus Darwin. The book of dissertations also had a note of \"other ingenious works of the late Mr Darwin in the Hands of the Editor, which may at some distant time be given to the public\". The only one discovered was Charles Darwin's unpublished manuscript on the pulse, which was found in the Medical Society of London.\nRelatives.\nCharles Darwin's younger brother Erasmus Darwin II became a rich solicitor, but in 1799 drowned himself in the River Derwent. The youngest of Erasmus Darwin's three sons, Robert Waring Darwin, followed his father and eldest brother into medicine, becoming a successful physician. He married Susannah Wedgwood, and in the family tradition they named their first boy after his grandfather and uncle, Erasmus Alvey Darwin who was known to the family as Eras. When their second boy was born they named him after his uncle and father, both medical men, Charles Robert Darwin. While he was a child they called him \"Bobby\", but he became known simply as Charles Darwin, eclipsing the memory of the short life of his uncle of that name.\nIn October 1825 the brothers Eras and Charles went to Edinburgh University, and in January they visited \"the old Dr. Duncan\", Charles wrote home \"What an extraordinary old man he is, now being past 80, &amp; continuing to lecture\", though Dr. Hawley, who had shown them round the city, thought Duncan was now failing. In an 1879 biographical sketch of his grandfather Erasmus Darwin, he outlined his uncle's life, and said that \"Professor Andrew Duncan, in whose family vault Charles was buried, cut a lock of hair from the corpse, and took it to a jeweller, whose apprentice, afterwards the famous Sir H. Raeburn, set it in a locket for a memorial. The venerable professor spoke to me about him with the warmest affection forty-seven years after his death, when I was a young medical student in Edinburgh.\""}

The municipal stadium of Ferrara is the fifth oldest Italian ground still in operation. \nIt was opened in September 1928 as Stadio Comunale; initially, it had a capacity of 4,000. It assumed its current name in February 1982 to honor the former president of the club Paolo Mazza, who died two months earlier.\nIn concomitance with the access of SPAL to Serie A, in 1951 it was subjected to a heavy restructuring that brought capacity to 25,000. Between 1960s and 1980s it was renovated again, stabilizing the number of possible spectators to 22,000 until mid-2000s.\nFrom 2005 to 2016, capacity was limited to 7,500 due to safety reasons and cost containment. In 2016\u201317, in conjunction with the club's promotion to Serie B and then Serie A, the stadium was restructured again to match the modern needs of comfort and safety. In summer 2018, further remodeling took place to bring capacity from 13,135 to 16,134 seats."}

He was elected as a Democrat state legislator representing the 51st District in the Missouri House of Representatives from January 1995 through January 2003. He practiced law, first in partnership with Ralph Monaco, and then in his own private practice in Lee's Summit, Missouri.\nEducation.\nFrom his 1998 legislator's biography: \"\"Rep. Bonner is a 1982 graduate of William Chrisman High School in Independence. He received a bachelor of arts degree in history in 1992 from the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City, and a master's degree in public administration in 1994 from the Bloch School of Business, also at the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City\"... \"\nBonner received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City School of Law.\nCareer.\nWith his district and constituents mainly in Independence, Missouri and parts of Kansas City, Missouri and adjoining communities, Bonner's tenure as legislator was marked by his \"bucking the tide\" and voting or speaking his conscience and the voice of his constituency even when in opposition to the party's leadership in the state's Capitol, Jefferson City, Missouri. Immediately branded a \"renegade\", Bonner was expelled from the Democratic Caucus in February 1995 just one month after being sworn in, for refusing to vote for an unprecedented eighth term for Speaker of the House Bob F. Griffin. \"He's got to go\", Bonner said [at the time]. \"Under Bob Griffin's style of government, the caucus is his circus. It's not an open body where you can discuss issues. He never will be challenged.\" Mr. Griffin later pleaded guilty to Federal corruption charges in 1998, and his sentence was commuted by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 2001.\nBonner later served as Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee for General Administration, as vice-chairman of the Commerce Committee, and was a member of the House Budget Committee. He was the primary sponsor of \"Jake's Law\", passed into law in 2001, which requires warrant checks on all individuals being released from jail.\nFrom his 1998 legislator's biography:\n\" ... He is a U.S. Army veteran, and served as a member of the Missouri Army National Guard, holding the rank of Sergeant First Class (E-7)...\"\nBonner was admitted to the Missouri Bar Association. As of May 25, 2016, he is listed as \"inactive\" which the association defines as attorneys who are \"in good standing with the Supreme Court of Missouri but are not eligible to practice law in Missouri.\"\nDisbarment.\n\"Bonner, who had a solo practice, admitted to violating five rules of professional conduct for attorneys and filed a motion with the court to voluntarily surrender his license to practice law in Missouri. Bonner was under investigation for mishandling his client's personal injury settlement funds.\nThe court cited 10 examples of Bonner delaying payments for one client until he got a new settlement from another, then using the money to repay the first client. The court also cited six examples of Bonner misappropriating about $55,000 in third-party funds that were designated for medical bills and other expenses and now not having the means to repay the money.\nBonner initially argued that he should be able to keep his law license so he could continue working to repay the money he owed, but the court disagreed and suspended his license pending a hearing on the disciplinary charges. He has now been disbarred.\""}

Intended as a cannon armed ground-attack aircraft, it was unsuccessful, only two being built.\nDesign and development.\nShortly after the outbreak of the First World War, the Royal Aircraft Factory began development of the F.E.4, a twin engined aircraft intended for ground attack to be armed with a COW autocannon.\nThe design had large two-bay biplane wings, with the longer upper wing fitted with strut-braced extensions that could be folded down during hangar storage. The lower wing was attached to the fuselage halfway up, so the aircraft sat close to the ground. In addition to the conventional landing gear there was a set of wheels mounted to the nose of the fuselage, to prevent damage if it tipped forward. The tailplane was large, with a central fin and two additional vertical surfaces for rudders.\nThe fuselage housed a crew of three, with the pilot and forward gunner sat in tandem in a large forward cockpit with dual controls. Despite a limited field of fire caused by being sat behind the pilot, the forward gunner was to be armed with two Lewis guns and a COW gun. A rear gunner sat behind the wings in a second cockpit.\nThe two engines, RAF 5s, were installed just above the lower wing in a pusher configuration.\nThe first F.E.4 was built in March 1916, and the second in July 1916. The second aircraft was fitted with Rolls-Royce engines, and did not include the rear cockpit. The intention was to put the rear gunner in an elevated section mounted above the wings, accessible by a ladder and hole in the upper wing, but this was never built.\nBoth aircraft were tested at Central Flying School beginning in May 1916, but neither performed well. In September 1916 the second F.E.4 was fitted with bomb-carrying equipment for further testing. Designs were created for engine upgrades, intended for RAF 3As, RAF 4As or RAF 4Bs, but no work was actually done."}

The team joined the Toronto-based Ontario Australian Football League's 'Rec Footy' program the same year competing against the Central Blues and Broadview Hawks reserve squads.\nIn late 2008 the Qu\u00e9bec Saints divided their squad into two 9-a-side 'Metro' teams (the Montr\u00e9al Saints, Laval Bombers and later in 2009 a third team the Pointe Claire Power) forming the basis of what is now known as AFL Quebec (prior to 2012 known as the Eastern Canadian Australian Football League or ECAFL). The Qu\u00e9bec Saints now act as the representative team of AFL Qu\u00e9bec.\nIn 2009 the OAFL relaunched 'Rec' Footy as OAFL Division 2. Five teams took part in the inaugural season including the Central Blues, Etobicoke Roos, Toronto Eagles, Broadview Hawks and Qu\u00e9bec Saints. The Saints competed in the division for two years. The team finally withdrew from the competition because of the extreme travel requirements. From 2011 onwards the Saints focused on playing exhibition matches and sending representatives to the United States Nationals tournament.\n2008.\nJust 49 days after the Saints conducted their first training session the team took on the Central Blues Reserves squad in Ottawa. In an upset the Saints won by four goals. The Saints suffered a loss in their second match against the Broadview Hawks later in the year. These matches between the three teams were the catalyst for the Ontario Australian Football League to consider an official second tier competition.\n2009.\nBefore the season began the Saints formed a partnership with the Ottawa Swans and became co-tenants of the Rideau Carleton Raceway along with the Ottawa division one club. After finishing the regular season on top of the ladder the Saints defeated the Central Blues by 103 points in the first semi-final to earn a berth in the inaugural OAFL Division 2 Grand Final.\nOn October 3, 2009 the Qu\u00e9bec Saints co-coached by Shane Blight and Matthew Wood, and captained by Cameron Stark, defeated the Broadview Hawks by 19 points in the Grand Final at Humber College North in Toronto. They Saints were awarded Mike Pyke Cup, the trophy named after the Sydney Swans ruckman, the first Canadian to play in the AFL. The Best players on the day included forward Mick Lacy, on-ballers Luke Anderson and Ben Vawser, as well as defender Renaud Carbonnel. On-baller Cam Stark claimed best on ground honours for the match.\n2009 also saw the Qu\u00e9bec Saints develop a women's team called Montr\u00e9al Angels. The Angels played a series of matches against the Montr\u00e9al Shamrocks GAA team and the newly formed Toronto Central Blues women's team.\nIn August 2009, club captain Cam Stark became the first Qu\u00e9bec Saint player to represent his/her country when he played for Canada Northwind in the 49th Parallel Cup against the United States in Mason, Ohio, USA. Montr\u00e9al Angels sisters Margo Legault and her younger sister Aimee Legault (who also both played for the Qu\u00e9bec Saints) were named members of the women's national team after their performances at the 2009 U.S Nationals in October.\n2010.\nThe Saints entered the 2010 OAFL Division 2 season under new full-time coach Luke Anderson. The team ended the regular season with a 7-1 win\u2013loss record and once again finished top of the ladder. The only loss of the season was to arch-rival club the Toronto Central Blues. The Saints then went on to defeat the Central Blues by 66 points in the 2nd Semi-final earning themselves a spot in their second consecutive Grand Final. After the Central Blues defeated the Toronto Rebel Dogs in the Preliminary Final, they advanced to the Grand Final where they once again met Qu\u00e9bec. The Saints went on to defeat the Blues by 48 points and claim their second premiership. Saints midfielder Darrin Haverhoek was named best on ground for the match.\n2011.\nPrior to the 2011 season the Saints announced they were withdrawing from the OAFL Division 2 competition. The club cited the enormous travel requirements and the subsequent financial burden as the reasons they would have to reluctantly withdraw. The Saints used the year to focus on growing the local ECAFL (now AFL Quebec) competition. As a result, the Qu\u00e9bec Saints did not participate in any official representative matches throughout the regular season. Two Saints players entered the U.S Nationals competition forming an alliance squad with three other clubs in division 4. The combine team made it through to the Grand Final where it lost by six points.\n2012.\nThe Saints played a series of exhibition matches throughout 2012, once again sending players to represent the team at the U.S Nationals. The first representative match of the year saw the Saints travel to Boston to take on the Boston River Rats. The young inexperienced squad performed well but were soundly beaten. The team sent three players to partner the Fort Lauderdale Fighting Squids in Division 4 of the U.S Nationals. The team was bundled out of the pool stages losing only one match to the Des Moines Roosters, the eventual champions of the division. The Qu\u00e9bec Saints rounded out their season with a match against the Ottawa Swans branded the \"Pony Fall Classic\".

He is best known for appearances with the Philly punk-metal band Saints in Hell and his solo project Ghostdance Tribe. He has also appeared for the professional wrestling promotions Combat Zone Wrestling and IWA Mid South as the manager of Cult Fiction.\nMusic and acting career.\nFrom 1980 through 1982 Gram was a founding member and the singer/frontman for Philly punk-metal band Saints in Hell, whose lineup also included future Cinderella members Tom Keifer and Eric Brittingham.\nIn 1986 Gram was involved as an actor and animal wrangler on the film \"Street Trash\".\n1991 saw the release of the indy CD/album \"Ghostdance Tribe\", with singer/guitarist Gram as the writer of all the material, and performances by Tom Keifer, Ronnie Younkins of The Kix, Bill Mattson of Tangier, all the members of Britny Fox, Kevin Moore of Dandelion and Johnny Dee of Doro.\nFor two weeks, in November 1999, Gram's Traditional Native Drum Group, The Sovereign Nation Singers were performing as part of a demonstration/event in front of The White House. Billy spent the final four days of that protest, in a ceremony, fasting inside a large teepee that had been set up on the ellipse adjacent to the White House.\nIn 2005 Gram directed a documentary on the career of pro wrestler Ox Baker. The film has yet to be released.\nIn 2006 Billy appeared as a zombie in the film \"\". Billy also appeared that year in \"The Meltdown Memoirs\", a documentary celebrating the 20th Anniversary of Street Trash.\nIn 2009 Billy was cast in director Fred Vogel's Anthology film \"The Murder Collection\" as a college professor of Native American studies. Due to a technical difficulty with a special effect and the fact that if any reshoots were attempted they then would not have enough time to do an acceptable cut of the film and still have enough time to fulfill a contracted release date, so sadly the entire segment was cut from the film. No word from ToeTag Pictures on an impending future release.\nIn 2010 Gram was cast as a cross-dressing, necrophiliac grave digger in director Anthony Matthews' Revenge is Her Middle Name. The film, with Billy's scenes intact was released in 2012. Two of Gram's old Ghostdance Tribe songs, \"Pain Makes the World Go 'Round\" and \"Electric Lovepump Blues\" are included as part of the soundtrack. Also in 2010, Billy was cast as The Demon/Indian in The Cemetery by director Adam Ahlbrandt and The Dungeon Master in director Tom Savini's Wet Dreams segment for the anthology film The Theatre Bizarre. The Theater Bizarre debuted at The Fantasia Film Festival in July 2011. The Cemetery was released in 2013. Gram was featured in the film's poster/cover painting.\nIn 2019 the projects Gram filmed with Ox Baker are set for release, around mid-year. Two separate films, a documentary I LOVE THE PEOPLE I HURT: The Life and Legend of the Mighty Ox Baker, and a short comedy feature (approximately 55 minutes) MY SMORGASBOARD WITH OX. The latter is co-starring and co-written by Gram and Baker.\nProfessional wrestling career.\nEarly career.\nBilly's initial training in professional wrestling took place at The Monster Factory in 1992. Gram worked sporadic indy shows from 1993 through 1995 and then quit the business.\nIn 2003, after befriending Toby Klein and Deranged, Gram re-entered the world of pro wrestling, working small independent shows as Klein's manager.\nIn 2003 Gram created the concept of his stable Cult Fiction. The initial concept, an Ultra-Violent Four Horseman meet the Manson Family. The original group was conceived as Gram, along with Klein, Deranged, Brain Damage and The Necro Butcher.\nCombat Zone Wrestling (2007\u20132010).\nIn 2007, Halfbreed Billy Gram debuted in both Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) and IWA Mid South, as the leader and manager of the faction known as Cult Fiction, whose members in the ensuing years have included \"Mister Insanity\" Toby Klein, Necro Butcher, Brain Damage, Deranged, Ox Baker, Masada, J. C. Bailey, , Tank, Tracy Smothers, Freakshow, Matt Tremont, J.D. Horror and Sage Sin\nLate in 2007, Billy also began working as a color commentator for CZW. Gram's two wrestling charges in 2007 Toby Klein and Necro Butcher spent 2007 feuding with members of the Maven Bentley Association. The final event of CZW's calendar year \"Cage of Death 9\" found Gram in the corner of Team CZW: Toby Klein, The Necro Butcher, Drake Younger and Danny Havoc as they took on Team MBA: D. J. Hyde, Brain Damage, Scotty Vortekz and Dustin Lee in the main event. At the end of 2007, the fans on CZW's official forums voted for their annual year end awards, and Gram was the winner of the award for \"Best Mic Work\".\nIn addition, throughout the course of 2008 Cult Fiction became even more visible in CZW. Gram was the color commentator for CZW throughout most of the year. His Cult Fiction stable was relaunched in CZW, first with the addition of Brain Damage, and later Deranged. At \"Cage of Death 10\", in the course of the semi-main event, a fans-bring-the-weapons match that saw Gram's charge Deranged against Gram's perennial nemesis D. J. Hyde, at some point during the course of mayhem and the ebb and flow of the Ultra-Violence, Hyde assaulted Gram with an electric staple gun to the body and face. The match was a brutal contest(even by CZW standards) with all three men involved, Hyde, Deranged and even Gram bleeding profusely, all three took various amounts of very rough punishment and assault, the end would come with DERANGED taking the win for CULT FICTION, after he pinned Hyde for a three count, after Deranged was declared the winner and Gram snuck in a bit of post match punishment on Hyde who was still lying on his back in the ring, LOBO would come to the ring, take a few weapons and added more insult and injury to Hyde, berating him on the microphone and then firing him from CZW, significant because it was a dramatic device that would set up the most integral storyline of the following year, D. J. would not be seen in CZW again until six months after he had been fired, at which point the fans were shocked quite thoroughly when Hyde returned and John Zandig announced that he had sold CZW to the hated D. J. This was acted out in a dramatic and scripted bit in front of the entire arena, but nonetheless, the sale was real and Hyde in fact did buy the promotion from its founder. Jumping back where we were, to Cage of Death 10, after the firing of D. J., there was a forty-minute intermission as the ring crew set up the actual Cage of Death. Once the setup was completed the Main Event, which saw six entrants all facing one another would commence. After the Semi Main Event and everything that had occurred, despite being beaten and injured Gram would also be in the corner of Brain Damage for the \"Main Event\", making this the second year in a row Billy had been involved in the Main Event at \"Cage of Death\".\nOnce again the fans on the aforementioned annual year end awards recognized Billy as he was again the winner of the award for \"Best Mic Work\", and for the first time \"Best Manager\", \"Best Commentator\" and the newly instituted \"Mother F'n Bomb\" award.\n2009 saw Gram and his Cult Fiction team of Brain Damage and Deranged feuding with longtime CZW mainstays the H8 Club consisting of Nick Gage, Nate Hatred and their manager Dewey Donovan. \"CZW Tournament of Death 8\" saw Gram in the corners of three CULT FICTION entrants, Brain Damage, Deranged and the returning Mister Insanity- Toby Klein with Gram delivering a mad display of fire breathing in the match between Deranged and Nick Gage. The end of the year saw Cult Fiction absent, with Gram alone confronting the new owner of Combat Zone Wrestling D. J. Hyde on several occasions demanding Cult Fiction's return. In December at \"Cage of Death 11\", Gram was involved in another exciting, memorable CZW moment, that will most certainly be being revisited for decade after decade in the future by CZW fans and other wrestling fans who will surely recognize this segment as significant, exciting and legendary. The show had begun with an insane opening bout, a no-ropes barbwire match contesting the CZW ULTRAVIOLENT UNDERGROUND CHAMPIONSHIP between the Champion, GERMANY's Thumbtack Jack and CZW's most prolific Original and mainstay. \"The Man\" Nick F'N Gage! The match was a brutal, intense war, both men beat each other horribly, both were covered in their own blood, both kept the pace quicker and more offense packed than can be explained, it must be seen, both were lacerated by the barbwire, both took insane punishment and refused to fold to the brutal assault of their opponent. The match lasted close to an hour to the amazement of the sold-out crowd at the infamous bingo hall, one of wrestling's most infamous and legendary venues, The Arena at Ritner and Swanson in South Philly, the fans were fully vested in the match, loud, energetic, as into a match as crowd can be and by the time that moment came after such a long match, that TJ was able to pin Gage and get the three count and retain the Championship, the crowd seemed as exhausted as the two grapplers, they were drained as if they had fought the match because of how invested they were, Jack was struggling to stay standing, it took all he had and he barely succeeded in lifting the belt in just one hand raised above his head, gage was bent over, barely standing and being helped from the ring by his manager Dewey Donovan, as that point there were some odd noises, fresh ones in the mix of the crowd, again then louder and then obvious there is something wrong amongst the fans and rows of chairs on the east side, then it begins visible, TJ has his back to that side, oblivious to anything amiss, but Dewey sees them!! His eyes widen and he shouts more emphatically at Nicky and looks panicked, \"Nicky come on!! Let's get out of here!!\" two men, there faces hidden and obscured by the hoods on their black sweat shirts are physically plowing right through the seats and fans toward the ring, the two men are tossing fans from their seats, pushing anyone who stands in front of them, aggressively and angrily clearing their own path through humans, Dewey just manages to get gage away from what's about to happen, the two hooded men quickly jump the rail and slide into the ring under the deadly barbwire, behind Thumbtack Jack who never sees it coming, as the taller of the two thugs screams and physically points desperate instructions, the other man, quite expertly shoves TJ from behind into the barbwire on the opposite side of the ring, the taller man is still shouting and both men quickly rip off their sweatshirts, half the crowd gasps in unison, losing their breath, stunned as the other half starts screaming, the two men are JC BAILEY and BILLY GRAM and both are wearing Cult Fiction T-shirts under their hoodies, no one had a clue that either man was even in the city, JC had been incarcerated in Kentucky for two years and Gram had apologized that he would not be at the event and then many of them saw promotional posters for a signing show in New York the same night and they listed and advertised Gram as one of the guests! This all happened so fast that it almost seemed to be slow motion because no one was missing anything, nothing else needed to be verbalized upon the crowd processing those well known shirts, who actually was wearing them and what it meant. As the hoodies were coming off Gram was pointing at TJ in the barbwire helpless, clearly spent and barely conscious, JC follows Gram's instructions and grabs TJ from the barbwire, Gram is screaming and pointing, there are cinder blocks in the center of the ring, Gram is going nuts and still giving orders and JC raises TJ upside down, feet above his head and gives TJ a wicked Brain Buster onto the cinder blocks!!! JC Bailey and Gram look almost gleeful as they embrace and pat each other's backs, both make some very short statements at the fans, they are making it all very clear, they taunt and laugh and casually stroll from the scene laughing and smiling. Cult Fiction have plans and they have started a War that will dominate the main storyline and feud of CZW for the following thirteen months, bits and pieces unfolding on every CZW show regardless of where in the world it occurs. The first bullet was this post match attack on European Death Match sensation Thumbtack Jack and to fulfill a two pronged shock and awe style tactic, Gram then revealed that JC Bailey was the newest member of his Cult Fiction stable. All the seeds were sown and for the first time in some years the fans were suddenly excited about what was ahead and couldn't wait for xmas to be over and were beyond excited for January's show, excited.\nTo close 2009, Gram and his Cult Fiction group were once again heavily acknowledged by fan votes in CZW's \"Annual Year end Awards\". For the third consecutive year Gram captured the Award for \"Best Mic Work\", and for the second consecutive year \"Best Manager\" (by a landslide with 71.79% of the vote) and \"Best Commentator\" (also a landslide with 72.22% of the vote, despite the fact that Billy had only been in the commentary position for half of TOD 8 and one other match the entire year). \"Tag Team of the Year\" was awarded to Cult Fiction (48.84% of the vote) and the \"Feud of the Year\" Award went to H8 Club vs. Cult Fiction (55.56% of the vote). \"Return of the Year\" award went to Cult Fiction member JC Bailey. \"Video of the Year\" award also went to Cult Fiction for \"Welcome to My Nightmare\" in a category that saw all five nominations consist of Cult Fiction music videos.\n2010 saw yet another, larger more dominant Cult Fiction emerge as Billy and Bailey were joined first by former N.J. All-Star Lucky, who was \"beaten into\" the faction by Bailey and Gram and christened with a new name, . These three were then joined by the returning Brain Damage and subsequently, International Death Match Superstar Masada. This version of Cult Fiction were immediately embroiled in a feud with Fan favorites Danny Havoc, Drake Younger, Scotty Vortekz and Eddie Kingston who were newly dubbed The Suicide Kings. Necro Butcher and John Zandig also sided with the Suicide Kings at various points throughout the feud.\nIn June 2010, Gram and Cult Fiction were a huge presence at \"CZW Tournament of Death\". Both JC Bailey and Masada with Billy in their corners were entrants in the tournament, and Brain Damage participated in a non-tournament grudge match against Drake Younger. An interesting storyline spilled from this event as in a post show interview, Gram, distraught over having been assaulted by Scotty Vortekz in his match against MASADA \"quit\" CZW. Many fans and co-workers believed Gram had seriously left the company. Gram made a shocking return in mid-August.\nGram and his Cult Fiction stable continued their feud with The Suicide Kings for the remainder of the year. Eventually Drake Younger turned heel and became an ally to Cult Fiction. The Suicide Kings two remaining original members were joined by Devon Moore and Dysfunction. The feud would culminate at \"Cage of Death XII\" in December 2010, with this Kings lineup facing Cult Fiction (Brain Damage, MASADA and ) and the newly monikered \"Golden Boy\" Drake Younger with Gram in their corner. After all the participants, save the winner Devon Moore had been eliminated, Gram found himself in the unenviable position of being alone with Moore atop the \"Cage of Death\". Moore threw Gram from the top of the structure. The result for Gram was five broken bones in his right foot and leg. This had been four consecutive years Billy had been on the \"Cage of Death\" show, three of the four as a manager in the actual \"Cage of Death\" match itself.\nIndependent Wrestling Association: Mid-South.\nIn 2008, Gram appeared frequently in Independent Wrestling Association: Mid-South leading the Cult Fiction stable. Managing Toby Klein, Brain Damage and Deranged. Later in the midst of a feud between Cult Fiction and Corporal Robinson, Tank would also become a member of the group. In October of that year Gram led his duo of Brain Damage and Deranged to victory in IWA MS's \"Double Death Tag Team Tournament\", as they defeated the teams of Necro Butcher and Toby Klein (who had temporarily defected from Cult Fiction), Corporal Robinson and Tracy Smothers (Smothers turned on his partner and joined Cult Fiction), Danny Havoc and Dysfunction, and in the finals Drake Younger and Devon Moore. This gave Brain Damage and Deranged the distinction of being the only wrestlers to ever win any major independent wrestling tournament twice in consecutive years.\nIndependent Wrestling Association: Deep South.\nIn 2011, Billy played a pivotal role in IWA Deep South's annual \"Carnage Cup\", where two more wrestlers Freakshow and Matt Tremont joined Cult Fiction.\nUnderground Empire Wrestling.\nOn July 11, 2015, Billy Gram made an unannounced appearance at Underground Empire Wrestling's Pledge Your Allegiance event (UEW is an independent promotion out of Los Angeles California), to announce JD Horror as the newest member of the Cult Fiction stable. Gram also managed the tag team of JD Horror and Homeless Jimmy in a bloody Tag Team Underground Rules Cagematch against BC Killer and The Insaniac. During his time in the Underground both Homeless Jimmy and Sage Sin would also join Gram's Cult Fiction stable. Sage was the only female member in the group's storied history. Gram not only appeared in front of the cameras as a manager and performer but also was a writer and on the booking for the promotion for six months. He directed and wrote promos for much of the roster during his tenure. He has since left the promotion. As is often the case it seems Gram did not part on good terms with the company.\nFeud with Ian Rotten.\nIn 2008, sometime around the end of the year, Gram become involved in a public feud with IWA-MS owner Ian Rotten. Billy made allegations that Rotten had physically threatened himself as well as members of the Cult Fiction faction that he leads. Gram publicly vowed that Cult Fiction would never again appear in IWA MS. Billy then went on a public bashing of Rotten, lampooning him on wrestling websites and message boards.\nIn early 2011, Billy finally confronted his nemesis Ian Rotten person to person on an internet wrestling show called \"And Then The Bell Rang\" hosted by Jerry Wiseman. Gram exploded on Rotten. Joe Bailey the father of JC Bailey, Bull Pain, Mickie Knuckles and Madman Pondo also confronted Rotten on the show. Days later, Billy appeared on the popular podcast Death By DVD on which he challenged Ian Rotten to meet him in a legit kickboxing match for charity., and to discuss his career at that time. Shortly after this, Rotten announced that he was closing the doors of his promotion IWA Mid-South. They remained closed for almost two years.\nWriter.\nIn 2008 \"One for the Fire: The Legacy of Night of the Living Dead\", a documentary written by Gram, was released. It celebrates the 40th Anniversary of the definitive horror film of Independent American Cinema. The film is included on the 40th Anniversary edition of \"Night of the Living Dead\" released by Dimension Films. The film was also included on the European Blu-ray release of George Romero's \"Diary of the Dead\", also from Dimension Films.\nThe film \"One for the Fire: The Legacy of Night of the Living Dead\" won a Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Award as best \"Horror DVD\" extra of the year 2008.\nCharles Manson.\nFor decades Gram publicly shared his beliefs that Charles Manson was convicted of crimes he did not commit, that he was not culpable in either the murders at Cielo Drive and that nor was he culpable in the murders on Waverly Drive, that Manson ordering brainwashed people to commit the murders was not true and that the prosecution's contention that inciting Helter Skelter was motive for the murders was a false and premeditated construct, tailored to aid in making Manson a patsy in order to cover the truth about what is really going in L.A. . \nIn 2017 Gram was involved behind the scenes and in front of the camera for a soon to be released documentary called Manson's Bloodlines which chronicles the life and struggle of Manson's grandson, former MMA fighter Jason \"Freebird\" Freeman.\nOn March 17, 2018, Gram delivered a eulogy at Manson's funeral and acted as a pallbearer. Subsequently, Gram has made several appearances on Brian Davis' TLB Radio podcasts describing Manson's funeral and his own beliefs concerning Manson, his friends and the infamous crimes linked to their names.\nAccomplishment.\nCombat Zone Wrestling"}

Clark and his accomplice, Carol Mary Bundy, were collectively known as the Sunset Strip Killers and were responsible for the deaths of at least seven individuals although they are considered suspects in the deaths of several other women and young girls. Clark was charged with six murders in Los Angeles, California and was convicted in 1983. Clark's victims were typically young prostitutes or teenage runaways and his victims were decapitated and their severed heads kept as mementos. He would also perform sex acts on their corpses.\nEarly life.\nDoug Clark was born on March 10, 1948, and was the third son of five children to a retired Naval Admiral turned international Naval Intelligence officer. Clark enjoyed a comfortable childhood as a \u201cmilitary brat.\u201d His family moved frequently during Clark's childhood due to his father's job, and he later claimed to have lived in thirty-seven countries including India, Switzerland, and the Marshall Islands. In 1958, his father left the Navy for a civilian position as an engineer with the Transport Company of Texas, but the family still moved around. Clark was sent to the exclusive International School of Geneva and later attended Culver Military Academy while his father continued to work abroad. As a teenager, Clark reportedly recorded his sexual escapades with girls at school without their knowledge and began developing dark sexual fantasies of rape, murder, mutilation and necrophilia.\nWhen he graduated in 1967, Clark enlisted in the U.S. Air Force stationed in Colorado and Ohio. Clark was eventually discharged from the Air Force, and he drifted around for the next decade, often working as a mechanic. He moved to Los Angeles and was employed as a steam plant operator for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, working at the Valley Generating Station before abruptly quitting. Subsequently, Clark became a boiler operator at the Jergens soap factory in Burbank, but was fired due to a high rate of absence and violent threats he had made against his co-workers. During this time, Clark also spent the majority of his spare time in local bars and nightclubs searching for lonely, older women to seduce them out of their money. \u201cHe was very good at murmuring in women's ears in country bars and getting them to sleep with him and give him a place to stay,\u201d author Louise Farr, who interviewed Clark and Bundy for her book \"The Sunset Murders\", said. \u201cHe was essentially a leech.\u201d Clark also called himself \"the king of the one-night stands.\" One of the bars he frequented in the area was Little Nashville, where he met 36-year-old Carol Bundy on Christmas Day in 1979. Bundy was a vocational nurse, and an overweight mother of two who had left her abusive husband in January 1979. Clark moved into her home the same night.\nMurders.\nBundy and Clark developed an intense sadomasochistic relationship with Clark frequently bringing sex workers back to the couple's apartment to have threesomes. Then, when Clark took an interest in an 11-year-old neighbour, Bundy helped lure the girl into posing for pornographic photographs. Clark quickly escalated from pedophilia, talking about how much he would like to kill a girl during sex. He persuaded Bundy to purchase two pistols for him to use, reportedly seeking to fulfill his fantasy of killing a woman during sex and feeling her vaginal contractions during the death spasms. During 1980, Bundy and Clark are believed to have claimed the lives of at least seven persons but both perpetrators also admitted culpability in the homicides of additional females.\nArrest and conviction.\nAfter his arrest, the murder weapons were found hidden at Clark's workplace. Bundy was charged with two murders: Murray and \"Cathy\" whose killing she confessed to having been present at. Clark was charged with six murders. At his trial, he acted as his defense counsel and tried to blame Bundy for everything, claiming he had been manipulated. The jury did not believe him, and he was sentenced to death in 1983. Clark is still on California's death row. Bundy made a plea bargain and in return for her testimony was sentenced to fifty-two-years-to-life imprisonment. Bundy died in prison from heart failure on December 9, 2003, at the age of 61.\nReferences.\nThe Sunset Murders by Louise Farr\nMost detailed and accurate account per those involved"}

Such early cave dwellers, and other prehistoric peoples, are also called \"cave men\" (the term also refers to the stereotypical \"caveman\" stock character type from fiction and popular culture). Despite the name, only a small portion of humanity has ever dwelt in caves: caves are rare across most of the world; most caves are dark, cold, and damp; and other cave inhabitants, such as bears and cave bears, cave lions, and cave hyenas, often made caves inhospitable for people.\nThe Grotte du Vallonnet, a cave in the French Riviera, was used by people approximately one million years ago. Although stone tools and the remains of eaten animals have been found in the cave, there is no indication that people dwelt in it.\nSince about 750,000 years ago, the Zhoukoudian cave system, in Beijing, China, has been inhabited by various species of human being, including Peking Man (\"Homo erectus pekinensis\") and modern humans (\"Homo sapiens\").\nStarting about 170,000 years ago, some \"Homo sapiens\" lived in some cave systems in what is now South Africa, such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Shelter. The stable temperatures of caves provided a cool habitat in summers and a warm, dry shelter in the winter. Remains of grass bedding have been found in nearby Border Cave.\nAbout 100,000 years ago, some Neanderthals dwelt in caves in Europe and western Asia. Caves there also were inhabited by some Cro-Magnons, from about 35,000 years ago until about 8000 B.C. Both species built shelters, including tents, at the mouths of caves and used the caves\u2019 dark interiors for ceremonies. The Cro-Magnon people also made representational paintings on cave walls.\nAlso about 100,000 years ago, some \"Homo sapiens\" worked in Blombos Cave, in what became South Africa. They made the earliest paint workshop now known, but apparently did not dwell in the caves.\nWriters of the classical Greek and Roman period made several allusions to cave-dwelling tribes in different parts of the world. For details, \"see\" \"Troglodytae\".\nHistorical.\nEspecially during war and other times of strife, small groups of people have lived temporarily in caves, where they have hidden or otherwise sought refuge. They also have used caves for clandestine and other special purposes while living elsewhere.\nPerhaps fleeing the violence of Ancient Romans, people left the Dead Sea Scrolls in eleven caves near Qumran, in what is now an area of the West Bank managed by Qumran National Park, in Israel. The documents remained undisturbed there for about 2,000 years, until their discovery in the 1940s and 1950s.\nThe DeSoto Caverns, in what became Alabama in the United States, were a burial ground for local tribes; the same caves became a violent speakeasy in the 1920s. The Caves of St. Louis may have been a hiding-place along the Underground Railroad.\nFrom about 1000 to about 1300, some Pueblo people lived in villages that they built beneath cliffs in what is now the Southwestern United States.\nIn Hirbet Tawani, near Yatta Village, in the Southern Hebron Hills, in an area contested by the Palestinian Authority and Israel, there are Palestinians living in caves. People also inhabited caves there during the time of the Ottoman Empire and of the British Mandate for Palestine. In recent years some have been evicted by the Israeli government and settlers.\nIn her book \"Home Life in Colonial Days\", Alice Morse Earle wrote of some of the first European settlers in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania living in cave dwellings, also known as \"smoaky homes\":\nIn Pennsylvania caves were used by newcomers as homes for a long time, certainly half a century. They generally were formed by digging into the ground about four feet in depth on the banks or low cliffs near the river front. The walls were then built up of sods or earth laid on poles or brush; thus half only of the chamber was really under ground. If dug into a side hill, the earth formed at least two walls. The roofs were layers of tree limbs covered over with sod, or bark, or rushes and bark. The chimneys were laid of cobblestone or sticks of wood mortared with clay and grass. The settlers were thankful even for these poor shelters, and declared that they found them comfortable. By 1685 many families were still living in caves in Pennsylvania, for the Governor's Council then ordered the caves to be destroyed and filled in.\nIn the 1970s, several members of the Tasaday apparently inhabited caves near Cotabato, in the Philippines.\nCaves at Sacromonte, near Granada, Spain, are home to about 3,000 Gitano people, whose dwellings range from single rooms to caves of nearly 200 rooms, along with churches, schools, and stores in the caves.\nSome families have built modern homes in caves, and renovated old ones, as in Missouri; Matera, Italy; and Spain.\nAt least 30,000,000 people in China live in cave homes, called yaodongs; because they are warm in the winter and cool in the summer, some people find caves more desirable than concrete homes in the city.\nIn the Australian desert mining towns of Coober Pedy and Lightning Ridge, many families have carved homes into the underground opal mines, to escape the heat.\nIn the Loire Valley, abandoned caves are being privately renovated as affordable housing.\nIn England, the rock houses at Kinver Edge were inhabited until the middle of the 20th century.\nIn Greece, some Christian hermits and saints are known by the epithet \"cave dweller\" () since they lived in cave dwellings; examples include Joseph the Cave Dweller (also known as Joseph the Hesychast) and Arsenios the Cave Dweller.\nIn 2021-2023 Beatriz Flamini spent 500 days alone in a cave in Spain in an experiment on the effects of social isolation."}

Tamil diaspora populations around the world expressed concerns regarding the conduct of the civil war in the island nation of Sri Lanka. The civil war, which took place between the Sri Lankan Army and the separatist group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam is believed to have killed over 100,000 civilians. Protesters and critics of the Sri Lankan government that triggered a culturally based civil war to be a systematic genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Sri Lankan Tamil minority in Sri Lanka.\nWhile opposition by Tamils was expressed at various stages of the war since 1983, opposition intensified in January 2009. Protesters appealed to international politicians intervene in the Sri Lankan Civil War and request a ceasefire, send humanitarian aid to the Northern Province, promote the creation of Tamil Eelam, and remove the LTTE from lists of terrorist organisations. After the government of Sri Lanka declared defeat over the LTTE on 18 May 2009, protests continued, accusing then-Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa of war crimes. Protests took several forms, including human chains, demonstrations, rallies, hunger strikes, and self-immolation.\nProtests occurred internationally and not in Sri Lanka itself. Following increasing protests in Chennai and other cities in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, predominantly peaceful demonstrations were held concurrently around the world by the Tamil diaspora, mainly in national capitals, central business districts, near embassies and high commissioner offices, and sites of national or supranational government. Protesters ranging from several dozens to several thousands gathered in the cities of Delhi, Bangalore, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, The Hague, Z\u00fcrich, Geneva, Bern, Oslo, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, New York City, Washington, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Auckland, Wellington, and Durban.\nNotable locations and events.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, large protests took place in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. Over a thousand protested during Sri Lankan foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama's visit to Australia on 14 October 2008. The protest took place in Canberra outside the National Press Club. The protesters accused the Sri Lankan government alleging attack on civilians and the prevention of aid by the United Nations reaching affected areas. In response to the protests, Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith stated that he raised the concern of the violence amid the civil war. He also assured that Australia insists that military means will not solve the problem and that a political solution can only result in the ending of the war.\nAfter several local demonstrations, mostly in Sydney, larger protests were organised within Australia during the month of April 2009, with the most significant one being the non-stop protest in Sydney. As of April, 60 rallies and protests had occurred across Australia. On 11 April, three Australian protesters began hunger strikes, like those concurrently occurring in Ottawa and London. The hunger strike ended on 17 April. On 17 April, a \"March for Peace\" took place in Canberra. On 13 April, protests took place in front of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's residence in Sydney, urging him to call an immediate ceasefire. Several hundred protesters rallied in North Sydney urging Joe Hockey, member for North Sydney, to take the concerns of his constituents to the Australian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Similar protests occurred on 22 April, as over 600 protesters converged outside Julie Owens's office to voice their frustration at the lack of action by the Australian Labour Government in preventing thousands of Tamil civilians from allegedly being killed by the Sri Lankan Military. A \"Boycott Sri Lankan Products\" campaign was launched in Sydney during the last week of April. The demonstrations occurred with a few roads being closed down to make way. The protests were paused for ANZAC Day on 25 April.\nIn three separate occasions, some Sinhalese Australians were targeted in hate crimes, such as acid attacks and home invasions, in Sydney on 10 May 2009.\nCanada.\nSome of the largest demonstrations against the Sri Lankan Civil War took place in Canada, mostly in Toronto and Ottawa, but also in Montreal, Vancouver and Calgary. Protesters attempted to appeal to the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, the President of the United States, Barack Obama and the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Canada, Bandula Jayasekara, to take action in ending the conflict.\nThe first notable demonstration took place on 28 January 2009 in front of the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Midtown Toronto involving a few hundred people. Protesters began to grow from then onwards. After negative remarks from Jayasekara, protests continued in front of the Consulate General of the United States on University Avenue. Protesters also convened on Parliament Hill in Ottawa for several days, before returning to continue in Toronto.\nIndia.\nIn India, large-scale protests took place primarily in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Protests, rallies, human chains, strikes and demonstrations have continuously taken place throughout Chennai by lawyers, politicians, activists, student groups, celebrities, and many organisations. The aim of the protests was to urge leaders, such as Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, leader of the opposition J. Jayalalitha, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Minister of External Affairs Pranab Mukherjee to intervene and stop the Sri Lankan Civil War and stop any diplomatic assistance or relations with Sri Lanka.\nTamil Nadu, which has the highest rate of self-immolation deaths among states in India, saw increased incidents in 2009. On 29 January 2009, journalist and activist K. Muthukumar was the first to kill himself while protesting against the Sri Lankan Civil War in Chennai; he left a four-page statement in which he accused the Indian government of a historical lack of sympathy towards Tamils and referred to Barack Obama as \"our hope\". Muthukumar's suicide was thought to intensify protests in Tamil Nadu and trigger uprisings around the world by the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora. At least a dozen other self-immolation deaths occurred in Tamil Nadu during the year protesting the Sri Lankan Civil War.\nNorway.\nNorway had acted as a peace mediator in Sri Lanka prior to it being asked to leave by the Sri Lankan government of Rajapakse which ended the ceasefire in 2006 after alleging multiple violations by the LTTE. Pro-LTTE Tamil communities and organisations within Norway organised large protests including ones outside the Parliament of Norway Building, Inkognitogata 18, and other parts of Oslo. There were also protests outside the Sri Lankan embassy where a few protesters broke into the embassy, making it the first violent movement in the Tamil diaspora protests around the world. Although no one was hurt, severe damage was done inside the Embassy of Sri Lanka. Hundreds of Tamils gathered in Bergen, organising a 48-hour famine protest starting on 20 November.\nSwitzerland.\nOn 19 February 2009, 26 year-old Murugathasan Varnakulasingham from London joined the ongoing protests in front of the United Nations Office in Geneva. Shortly after 20:00 CET, he doused himself in gasoline and set himself on fire. Police attempted to rescue him but he succumbed to his injuries. A statement letter he wrote in English and Tamil read, \"We Tamils, displaced and all over the world, loudly raised our problems and asked for help before [the] international community in your own language for three decades. But nothing happened ... So I decided to sacrifice my life ... The flames over my body will be a torch to guide you through the liberation path.\" According to his brother, Murugathasan emigrated from Sri Lanka seven years prior to his death and reports and images from the civil war being circulated via internet and news media would leave him emotional. His self-immolation was an apparent copycat suicide following similar deaths during protests in Tamil Nadu.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe largest of the protests occurred in the United Kingdom. Protests were organised by the British Tamil Forum, a prominent diaspora organisation and a key association organising of the event, aiming to encourage British intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War. The first protest began on 18 January 2009 with around 9000 British Tamils in front of 10 Downing Street in London, participating in a mass vigil. A larger scaled protest occurred on 31 January 2009 which attracted a crowd of around 150,000 Tamils.\nOn 6 April an ongoing protest began, which continued into the middle of May. The next major protest took place on 11 April 2009, which attracted more than 200,000 Tamils. While the protesters diminished in numbers later on in the day, a number of people took place in non-stop protests on the streets, similar to protests that occurred in Canada. Two British Tamils, 21-year-old Sivatharsan Sivakumaravel and 28-year-old Parameswaran Subramanyam, went on hunger strike. On 11 May, the protesters in Parliament Square \"spilled through police lines\" causing roads to be blocked, with the protesters \"noisy but peaceful.\"\nIn October 2009 the \"Daily Mail\" falsely claimed that a police surveillance team had been watching the two hunger strikers discovered that Subramanyam had been secretly eating McDonald's sandwiches with the help of clandestine deliveries. Subramaniyan denied the \"Daily Mail\"'s allegations, calling them \"entirely baseless\" and a \"conspiracy to defame the Tamil struggle\". He stated that he also had medical proof. The police refused to discuss the allegations. The false claims were widely reported in the Sri Lankan media, allowing the Sri Lankan government and its supporters used them to condemn the Tamil protesters. Subramanyam then took legal action for libel against the \"Daily Mail\" and \"The Sun\", which had repeated the false claims. He won the settlement in June 2010. The newspapers accepted that the claims had been entirely false, apologised to Subramanyam and paid him a total of \u00a377,500 in damages - \u00a330,000 from The Sun, and \u00a347,500 from the Daily Mail - and paid his legal costs.\nIt was discovered that the United Kingdom sold arms to Sri Lanka worth over \u00a313.6 million in the last three years of the conflict, contravening the 1998 Code of Conduct on Arms Exports by the European Union that restricts business with countries facing internal conflicts or with poor human rights records and a history of violating international law. Several members of parliament expressed anger at the development. Four committees in the House of Commons expressed concern in a joint statement that arms made in the United Kingdom were fired on civilians during battles in Sri Lanka. In their annual report, the cross-party committees on arms export controls recommended the government should review all arms exports to Sri Lanka following the crackdown on rebels. The MPs also questioned the government's commitment to tackling corruption and bribery and called on ministers to investigate what British-supplied military equipment was used in the campaign against the Tamils.\nA number of protesters, such as Jan Jananayagam of Tamils Against Genocide, reiterated to the BBC that Tamils lived under \"existential threat\" in North Eastern Sri Lanka, that delayed recognition of genocidal acts cost lives, and that based on its record in Rwanda, the United Nations had not proved that it alone could defend Tamil people.\nA Sinhalese Buddhist temple in Kingsbury was attacked and its members blamed LTTE sympathisers for the attack. A Sinhalese chicken shop chain had experienced attacks at several of its locations by Tamil vandals in late May and its staff were threatened. The owner noted that his staff was shouted at and asked if they were Tamil or Sinhalese. One month earlier, a gang had threatened to burn down his restaurant and accused him of supporting the Sri Lankan government."}

The old city, which is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, contains numerous archaeological sites, including some historical churches and mosques. Many cultures have left their mark, especially Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and Islamic. In 1979, the historical center of the city, surrounded by walls of Roman era, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In June 2013, UNESCO included all Syrian sites on the list of World Heritage in Danger to warn of the risks to which they are exposed because of the Syrian Civil War.\nOrigins and founding.\nLying on the south bank of Barada River, the ancient city was founded in the 3rd millennium B.C. The horizontal diameter of the oval is about 1.5\u00a0km (0.9\u00a0mi) which is known as Damascus Straight Street, while the vertical diameter () is about 1\u00a0km (0.6\u00a0mi). With an approximate area of 86.12 hectares (212.8 acres; 0.86 km2), the ancient city was enclosed within a historic wall of 4.5\u00a0km (2.8\u00a0mi) in circuit that was mainly built by the Romans, then fortified by the Ayyubids and Mamluks.\nThe first mentioning of Damascus was as \"Ta-ms-qu\" in the second millennium BC, it was situated in an Amorite region in the middle of a conflict zone between the Hittites and Egyptians. The city exercised tributary until the emergence of the Sea Peoples in 1200 BC whose raids helped in weakening the arch rivals. Consequently, the Semitic Arameans managed to establish the independent state of Aram-Damascus (11th century \u2013 733 BC), naming the main city as \u2018Dimashqu\u2019 or \u2018Darmeseq\u2019.\nHistorical timeline.\nThroughout its history, Damascus has been part of the following states:\nMain sights.\nDamascus has a wealth of historical sites dating back to many different periods of the city's history. Since the city has been built up with every passing occupation, it has become almost impossible to excavate all the ruins of Damascus that lie up to below the modern level. The Citadel of Damascus is located in the northwest corner of the Old City. The \"Damascus Straight Street\" (referred to in the conversion of St. Paul in Acts 9:11), also known as the \"Via Recta\", was the decumanus (east\u2013west main street) of Roman Damascus, and extended for over . Today, it consists of the street of Bab Sharqi and the Souk Medhat Pasha, a covered market. The Bab Sharqi street is filled with small shops and leads to the old Christian quarter of Bab Tuma (St. Thomas's Gate). Medhat Pasha Souq is also a main market in Damascus and was named after Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman governor of Syria who renovated the Souk. At the end of the Bab Sharqi street, one reaches the House of Ananias, an underground chapel that was the cellar of Ananias's house. The Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus, is one of the largest mosques in the world and also one of the oldest sites of continuous prayer since the rise of Islam. A shrine in the mosque is said to contain the body of St. John the Baptist. The mausoleum where Saladin was buried is located in the gardens just outside the mosque. Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque, the shrine of the youngest daughter of Husayn ibn Ali, can also be found near the Umayyad Mosque. The ancient district of Amara is also within a walking distance from these sites. Another heavily visited site is Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque, where the tomb of Zaynab bint Ali is believed to be located.\nGates.\nThe old part of the city is surrounded with 4.5-kilometre-long (2.8-mile) thick walls, pierced by the seven historical gates, the eighth gate was added later by Muslims. These are, clockwise from the north-east side:\nHammams.\nThe presence of public baths (\u1e25amm\u0101ms) in Damascus started during the Umayyad era, while some historians date them back to the Roman era. The Damascene baths were mentioned by a number of Damascus historians, such as Ibn 'Asakir (1106\u20131175 AD) in his famous book \"The History of Damascus\". In his book, Ibn 'Asakir named 77 of baths working at that time within the city. The historian Ibn Shaddad counted 114 baths located in Damascus in 1250 AD.\nThe number of these baths increased to 365 during the Ottoman era, then decreased drastically to reach 60 baths in the late nineteenth century AD. Today, however, the number of baths in full operation is barely 20, the most famous of them is the \"Nour al-Din al-Shahid\" bath in the Al-Buzuriyah Souq.\nPreservation of the ancient city.\nThreats to the future of the old City.\nDue to the rapid decline of the population of Old Damascus (between 1995 and 2009 about 30,000 people moved out of the old city for more modern accommodation), a growing number of buildings are being abandoned or are falling into disrepair. In March 2007, the local government announced that it would be demolishing Old City buildings along a stretch of rampart walls as part of a redevelopment scheme. These factors resulted in the Old City being placed by the World Monuments Fund on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world. It is hoped that its inclusion on the list will draw more public awareness to these significant threats to the future of the historic Old City of Damascus.\nCurrent state of old Damascus.\nIn spite of the recommendations of the UNESCO World Heritage Center:\nIn October 2010, Global Heritage Fund named Damascus one of 12 cultural heritage sites most \"on the verge\" of irreparable loss and destruction.\nThe old city outside of the walls of the Roman era, is also considered part of the old Damascus, however, it hasn't been given the same historical priority. During the French mandate, Michel \u00c9cochard, the French architect, planned an urban scheme for the city, that advised to only reserve the parts of the old city inside the Roman walls. This approach has been adopted later by the ruling governments of Syria, which contributed to demolishing parts of its old neighborhoods. Old houses in Sarouja, Al Midan, and Shagour Barrani was replaced by new buildings for trade mainly."}

The series was created by Mike Reiss and directed by Xeth Feinberg. Unlike Reiss and Feinberg's later series for Icebox, \"Queer Duck\", Hard Drinkin' Lincoln did not receive attention from other media outlets, but still received some coverage.\nSynopsis.\nThe series portrays Abraham Lincoln (voiced by Jim Ward) as a boorish alcoholic who enjoys pestering his wife Mary Todd Lincoln (voiced by Jocelyn Blue, later Tress MacNeille) and causing trouble during shows at Ford's Theatre. Many episodes end with Hard Drinkin' Lincoln being shot by John Wilkes Booth (the main antagonist, voiced by Maurice LaMarche), often to the delight of bystanders. Other historical figures who appear in the episodes include Jenny Lind, Mohandas Gandhi, Ulysses S. Grant, Robert E. Lee and Frederick Douglass. Creator Reiss explained: \"What makes me proud of 'Hard Drinkin' Lincoln' is that it's a totally undeserved attack. The comedy comes from the fact that this man did nothing to deserve this.\"\nReception.\nRichard von Busack of MetroActive said that the series had witty \"moments of humor\" and praised the cartoons on Icebox.com, adding that he never heard the theme song of the series \"without a surge of patriotism,\" adding that the animated series is \"a reminder of the sacredness of the First Amendment.\" Joshua Shenk of \"The American Prospect\" described the show as a \"typical Lincoln image\" and said that Lincoln, in the show, \"is a blend of Homer Simpson and Kenny from South Park.\" Academic Barry Schwartz described the show as one of the recent Lincoln spoofs which are \"cut from the same cloth as ongoing museum controversies involving \"transgressive\" art.\" Wired described the series as \"improbable\" and one of the company's entrances into a \"crowded world of online animation entertainment sites\" and the \"Baltimore Sun\" said that critics and visitors have \"raved over\" the show. Scott Bass of \"Streaming Media\" described the comedy of \"Mr. Wong\" and \"Hard Drinkin' Lincoln\" as \"so edgy\" that he could not \"imagine seeing it on TV.\""}

The necessary quality for an asset is that value remains after the period of analysis so it can be used as a store of value. As such, financial instruments like corporate bonds and common stocks are assets because they store value for the next period. If the good or factor is used up before the next period, there would be nothing upon which to place a value.\nAs a result of this definition, assets only have positive futures prices. This is analogous to the distinction between consumer durables and non-durables. Durables last more than one year. A classic durable is an automobile. A classic non-durable is an apple, which is eaten and lasts less than one year. Assets are that category of output which economic theory places prices upon. In a simple Walrasian equilibrium model, there is but a single period and all items have prices. In a multi-period equilibrium model, while all items have prices in the current period. Only assets can survive into the next period and thus only assets can store value and as a result, only assets have a price today for delivery tomorrow. Items which depreciate 100% by tomorrow have no price for delivery tomorrow because by tomorrow it ceases to exist.\nThe subfield of asset pricing (or valuation) is the financial evaluation of the value of such assets; the primary method used by today's financial analysts is the discounted cash flow method. With this method, an asset's future cash flows are either assumed to be known with certainty (as in a treasury bond which is risk free) or estimated. These future cash flows are discounting used present values.\nThe Flow of Funds tables from the Federal Reserve System provide data about assets, which are tangible assets and financial assets, and liabilities. The difference, assets minus liabilities, is net worth."}
